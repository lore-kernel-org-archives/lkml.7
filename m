FWIW I'm still only interested in solving this problem generically, 
because in principle it's not specific to PCI, for PCI it's certainly 
not specific to iproc, and either way it's not specific to DT. That 
said, I don't care strongly enough to keep pushing back on this 
implementation outright, since it's not something which couldn't be 
cleaned up 'properly' in future.

One general comment I'd make, though, is that AFAIK PCI has a concept of 
inbound windows much more than it has a concept of gaps-between-windows, 
so if the PCI layer is going to track anything it should probably be the 
actual windows, and leave the DMA layer to invert them into the 
reservations it cares about as it consumes the list. That way you can 
also avoid the undocumented requirement for the firmware to keep the 
ranges property sorted in the first place.
