Yeah, you both have a good point that doing it now and only for this
message is not necessarily better than not doing it at all. And doing
a general overhaul is out of scope for this series, obviously. I
didn't really mind the current solution before and I mind it even less
now, so consider me satisfied :) I was really just thinking out
loud...
