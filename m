Right, if there's a pre-configured 1:1 mapping in the IOMMU such that
the device can ignore the IOMMU for all practical purposes I would
indeed say that the logic would apply to IOMMUs as well. :-)

I guess I'm still struggling with the purpose of signalling to the
driver that the host may not have access to memory addresses that it
will never try to access.

Ok, makes sense.

Great!

Hm, it didn't occur to me it could be an issue. I'll try.

You mean, have legacy guests use virtio-iommu to request an IOMMU
bypass? If so, it's an interesting idea for new guests but it doesn't
help with guests that are out today in the field, which don't have A
virtio-iommu driver.

Yes, that's correct. pSeries guests running on KVM are in a gray area
where theoretically they use an IOMMU but in practice KVM ignores it.
It's unfortunate but it's the reality on the ground today. :-/
