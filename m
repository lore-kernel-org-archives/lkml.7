+Early Printk
+============
+
+Mini-HOWTO for using the earlyprintk=dbgp boot option with a
+USB2 Debug port key and a debug cable, on x86 systems.
+
+You need two computers, the 'USB debug key' special gadget and
+and two USB cables, connected like this::
+
+  [host/target] <-------> [USB debug key] <-------> [client/console]
+
+There are a number of specific hardware requirements
+====================================================
+
+ a) Host/target system needs to have USB debug port capability.
+
+  You can check this capability by looking at a 'Debug port' bit in
+  the lspci -vvv output::
+
+    # lspci -vvv
+    ...
+    00:1d.7 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) USB2 EHCI Controller #1 (rev 03) (prog-if 20 [EHCI])

+                    Status: D0 PME-Enable- DSel=0 DScale=0 PME+
+            Capabilities: [58] Debug port: BAR=1 offset=00a0
+                                ^^^^^^^^^^^ <==================== [ HERE ]
+      Kernel driver in use: ehci_hcd
+            Kernel modules: ehci-hcd
+    ...
+
+  If your system does not list a debug port capability then you probably
+  won't be able to use the USB debug key.
+
+ b) You also need a NetChip USB debug cable/key:
+
+        http://www.plxtech.com/products/NET2000/NET20DC/default.asp
+
+    This is a small blue plastic connector with two USB connections;
+    it draws power from its USB connections.
+
+ c) You need a second client/console system with a high speed USB 2.0 port.
+
+ d) The NetChip device must be plugged directly into the physical
+    debug port on the "host/target" system.  You cannot use a USB hub in
+    between the physical debug port and the "host/target" system.
+
+    The EHCI debug controller is bound to a specific physical USB
+    port and the NetChip device will only work as an early printk
+    device in this port.  The EHCI host controllers are electrically
+    wired such that the EHCI debug controller is hooked up to the
+    first physical port and there is no way to change this via software.
+    You can find the physical port through experimentation by trying
+    each physical port on the system and rebooting.  Or you can try
+    and use lsusb or look at the kernel info messages emitted by the
+    usb stack when you plug a usb device into various ports on the
+    "host/target" system.
+
+    Some hardware vendors do not expose the usb debug port with a
+    physical connector and if you find such a device send a complaint
+    to the hardware vendor, because there is no reason not to wire
+    this port into one of the physically accessible ports.
+
+ e) It is also important to note, that many versions of the NetChip
+    device require the "client/console" system to be plugged into the
+    right hand side of the device (with the product logo facing up and
+    readable left to right).  The reason being is that the 5 volt
+    power supply is taken from only one side of the device and it
+    must be the side that does not get rebooted.
+
+Software requirements
+=====================
+
+ a) On the host/target system:
+
+    You need to enable the following kernel config option::
+
+      CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK_DBGP=y
+
+    And you need to add the boot command line: "earlyprintk=dbgp".
+
+    .. note:: If you are using Grub, append it to the 'kernel' line in
+     /etc/grub.conf.  If you are using Grub2 on a BIOS firmware system,
+     append it to the 'linux' line in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg. If you are
+     using Grub2 on an EFI firmware system, append it to the 'linux'
+     or 'linuxefi' line in /boot/grub2/grub.cfg or
+     /boot/efi/EFI/<distro>/grub.cfg.)
+
+    On systems with more than one EHCI debug controller you must
+    specify the correct EHCI debug controller number.  The ordering
+    comes from the PCI bus enumeration of the EHCI controllers.  The
+    default with no number argument is "0" or the first EHCI debug
+    controller.  To use the second EHCI debug controller, you would
+    use the command line: "earlyprintk=dbgp1"
+
+    NOTE: normally earlyprintk console gets turned off once the
+    regular console is alive - use "earlyprintk=dbgp,keep" to keep
+    this channel open beyond early bootup. This can be useful for
+    debugging crashes under Xorg, etc.
+
+ b) On the client/console system:
+
+    You should enable the following kernel config option::
+
+      CONFIG_USB_SERIAL_DEBUG=y
+
+    On the next bootup with the modified kernel you should
+    get a /dev/ttyUSBx device(s).
+
+    Now this channel of kernel messages is ready to be used: start
+    your favorite terminal emulator (minicom, etc.) and set
+    it up to use /dev/ttyUSB0 - or use a raw 'cat /dev/ttyUSBx' to
+    see the raw output.
+
+ c) On Nvidia Southbridge based systems: the kernel will try to probe
+    and find out which port has a debug device connected.
+
+Testing that it works fine
+==========================
+
+  You can test the output by using earlyprintk=dbgp,keep and provoking
+  kernel messages on the host/target system. You can provoke a harmless
+  kernel message by for example doing::
+
+    echo h > /proc/sysrq-trigger
+
+  On the host/target system you should see this help line in "dmesg" output::
+
+    SysRq : HELP : loglevel(0-9) reBoot Crashdump terminate-all-tasks(E) memory-full-oom-kill(F) kill-all-tasks(I) saK show-backtrace-all-active-cpus(L) show-memory-usage(M) nice-all-RT-tasks(N) powerOff show-registers(P) show-all-timers(Q) unRaw Sync show-task-states(T) Unmount show-blocked-tasks(W) dump-ftrace-buffer(Z)
+
+  On the client/console system do::
+
+    cat /dev/ttyUSB0
+
+  And you should see the help line above displayed shortly after you've
+  provoked it on the host system.
+
+If it does not work then please ask about it on the linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
+mailing list or contact the x86 maintainers.
