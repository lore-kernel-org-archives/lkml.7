If somebody could provide an Ack on this patch, I'd really appreciate it,
please. Whilst the portable ordering guarantees that I've documented are
fairly conservative, I do think that this change is a big improvement and
gives you what you need if you're writing a portable device driver for a new
piece of hardware. I'm tackling the removal of MMIOWB as a separate series.

I think Paul now requires an Ack before he'll send a patch to mainline,
hence the grovelling.

Cheers,

Will
