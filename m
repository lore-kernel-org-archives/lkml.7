+Abstract
+========
 The Linux ACPI subsystem converts ACPI namespace objects into a Linux
 device tree under the /sys/devices/LNXSYSTEM:00 and updates it upon
-receiving ACPI hotplug notification events.  For each device object in this
-hierarchy there is a corresponding symbolic link in the
+receiving ACPI hotplug notification events.  For each device object
+in this hierarchy there is a corresponding symbolic link in the
 /sys/bus/acpi/devices.
+
 This document illustrates the structure of the ACPI device tree.
 
+ACPI Definition Blocks
+======================
+
+The ACPI firmware sets up RSDP (Root System Description Pointer) in the
+system memory address space pointing to the XSDT (Extended System
+Description Table).  The XSDT always points to the FADT (Fixed ACPI
+Description Table) using its first entry, the data within the FADT
+includes various fixed-length entries that describe fixed ACPI features
+of the hardware.  The FADT contains a pointer to the DSDT
+(Differentiated System Descripition Table).  The XSDT also contains
+entries pointing to possibly multiple SSDTs (Secondary System
+Description Table).
+
+The DSDT and SSDT data is organized in data structures called definition
+blocks that contain definitions of various objects, including ACPI
+control methods, encoded in AML (ACPI Machine Language).  The data block
+of the DSDT along with the contents of SSDTs represents a hierarchical
+data structure called the ACPI namespace whose topology reflects the
+structure of the underlying hardware platform.
+
+The relationships between ACPI System Definition Tables described above
+are illustrated in the following diagram::

+Linux ACPI Device Objects
+=========================
 
-   The Linux kernel's core ACPI subsystem creates struct acpi_device
-   objects for ACPI namespace objects representing devices, power resources
-   processors, thermal zones.  Those objects are exported to user space via
-   sysfs as directories in the subtree under /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00.  The
-   format of their names is <bus_id:instance>, where 'bus_id' refers to the
-   ACPI namespace representation of the given object and 'instance' is used
-   for distinguishing different object of the same 'bus_id' (it is
-   two-digit decimal representation of an unsigned integer).

+Linux ACPI Physical Device Glue
+===============================
+
+ACPI device (i.e. struct acpi_device) objects may be linked to other
+objects in the Linux' device hierarchy that represent "physical" devices
+(for example, devices on the PCI bus).  If that happens, it means that
+the ACPI device object is a "companion" of a device otherwise
+represented in a different way and is used (1) to provide configuration
+information on that device which cannot be obtained by other means and
+(2) to do specific things to the device with the help of its ACPI
+control methods.  One ACPI device object may be linked this way to
+multiple "physical" devices.
+
+If an ACPI device object is linked to a "physical" device, its sysfs
+directory contains the "physical_node" symbolic link to the sysfs
+directory of the target device object.  In turn, the target device's
+sysfs directory will then contain the "firmware_node" symbolic link to
+the sysfs directory of the companion ACPI device object.
+The linking mechanism relies on device identification provided by the
+ACPI namespace.  For example, if there's an ACPI namespace object
+representing a PCI device (i.e. a device object under an ACPI namespace
+object representing a PCI bridge) whose _ADR returns 0x00020000 and the
+bus number of the parent PCI bridge is 0, the sysfs directory
+representing the struct acpi_device object created for that ACPI
+namespace object will contain the 'physical_node' symbolic link to the
+/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:02:0/ sysfs directory of the
+corresponding PCI device.
+
+The linking mechanism is generally bus-specific.  The core of its
+implementation is located in the drivers/acpi/glue.c file, but there are
+complementary parts depending on the bus types in question located
+elsewhere.  For example, the PCI-specific part of it is located in
