The need for the VMA's refcount is to ensure that the VMA will remain 
until the end of the SPF handler. This is a consequence of the use of 
RCU instead of SRCU to protect the RB tree.

I was not aware of the refcount_t type, it would be better here to avoid 
wrapping.

When I did test using SRCU it was involving a lot a scheduling to run 
the SRCU callback mechanism. In some workload the impact on the 
perfomance was significant [1].

I can't see this overhead using RCU.

Doing prefaulting should be doable, I'll try to think further about that.

Regarding the refcount, I should I missed something, this is an atomic 
counter, so there should not be contention on it but cache exclusivity, 
not ideal I agree but I can't see what else to use here.

I'm not opposed to use another mechanism here, but SRCU didn't show good 
performance with some workload, and I can't see how to use RCU without a 
reference counter here. So please, advise.

Thanks,
Laurent.
