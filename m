I forgot to update the review tag but Ralph did review v5:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/564
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/561
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/558
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/710
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/711
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/695
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/738
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/2/22/757

and since this v6 is a rebase just with better comments here and
there i believe those reviews holds.

This to show that they are end user and that those end user are
wanted. Also obviously i will be using this within HMM and thus
it will be use by mlx5, nouveau and amdgpu (which are all the
HMM user that are either upstream or queue up for 5.2 or 5.3).

> So we have some work to do, please.  Who would be suitable reviewers?

Anyone willing to review mmu notifier code. I believe this patchset is
not that hard to review this is about giving contextual informations
on why mmu notifier are happening it does not change the logic of any-
thing. They are no maintainers for the mmu notifier so i don't have a
person i can single out for review, thought given i have been the one
doing most changes in that area it could fall on me ...

Cheers,
Jérôme
