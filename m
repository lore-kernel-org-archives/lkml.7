Ah, I see.  Hmmm.  This definitely warrants a comment in
advk_pcie_probe() about the connection.

I appreciate that ab78029ecc34 ("drivers/pinctrl: grab default handles
from device core") saves some boilerplate from drivers, but ... at the
same time, it makes for some non-obvious implicit connections like
this.  I'm not sure whether having the boilerplate or the comment is
worse.  But I'm pretty sure the "no boilerplate, no comment" option is
the worst of the three :)

I vote for 100ms so it's easily tied to the spec.  We *should* have a
PCI core #define for that to make it even easier.

PCI_PM_D3COLD_WAIT might be close, but we might need some cleanup in
this area.  There are a whole bunch of "msleep(100)" calls in
drivers/pci that probably should use the same #define.  Somebody
should look through pci_af_flr(), pcie_flr(), pci_pm_reset(),
pcie_wait_for_link(), to see if we can use a common constant.
