It's an important question because the behavior of console printing has
changed. (Or, rather, is in the process of being changed. Depending on
complaints/approval, it may change some more.)

The atomic print allows important messages to be print immediately
(regardless of the context of the printer). This means that if any other
context was already printing, it will be interrupted. This cannot be
synchronized without causing significant scheduling delays.

The atomic messages always do the interrupting and will continue to the
end of the line. So it should be possible to piece the non-atomic
messages back together. However, I am a bit confused by your output. Is
it possible that I could see the full boot log?

The main goal of the atomic messages is so that you never lose any
important messages. To help readability, perhaps the atomic messages
should begin with a '\n' as well?
