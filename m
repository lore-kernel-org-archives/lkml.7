Not exactly...

F_WRLCK and F_RDLCK leases can both be broken, and will eventually time
out if there is conflicting access. The F_EXCLUSIVE flag on the other
hand is there to prevent any sort of lease break from 

I'm guessing what Ira really wants with the F_EXCLUSIVE flag is
something akin to what happens when we set fl_break_time to 0 in the
nfsd code. nfsd never wants the locks code to time out a lease of any
sort, since it handles that timeout itself.

If you're going to add this functionality, it'd be good to also convert
knfsd to use it as well, so we don't end up with multiple ways to deal
with that situation.
