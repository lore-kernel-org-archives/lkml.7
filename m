Cute.  Now we just distros to work out the kinks and to ship these as
sudo and su :)

This CAP_KILL trick makes me nervous.  This particular permission is
really quite powerful, and it would need some analysis to conclude
that it's not *more* powerful than CAP_KILL.

Indeed.

At the risk of saying a dirty word, the Windows API works quite a bit
like this :)
