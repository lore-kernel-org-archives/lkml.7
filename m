Thanks for joining in.

I actually have the kind of (relatively) low-power system with your crypto
accelerator IP. But it doesn't matter how great performance or energy saving
I would get from using crypto offloading. I will continue to use CPU only
solution for the foreseeable future.

Because of one tiny problem:

The firmware files for eip197(?) crypto accelerator are secrets we are not
allowed download anywhere from.
