Maybe I'm missing something, but on x86, drivers like f71882fg do not
crash the system because inb() *never* causes a crash.

If you want to build that driver for ARM, I think you need to make
sure that inb() on ARM also *never* causes a crash.  I don't think
changing f71882fg and all the similar drivers is the right answer.
