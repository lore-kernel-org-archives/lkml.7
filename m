Understood.

The check for the LTSSM is carried out through advk_pcie_link_up()
(ie register CFG_REG), correct ?

When you say "poll" you mean checking advk_pcie_link_up() ?

More below on the code.

No problems, it is not your fault.

When you say "missed" you mean advk_pcie_link_up() returning true, right ?

That's the bit I find confusing. Is this check here to detect if the
link went through the sequence below ? Should not it be carried
out only if (pcie->rl_asked == 1) ?

"... LTSSM will transit from 0x10 -> 0xB -> 0xD -> 0xC or 0xE
 ........... -> 0x10".

This ensures that if the LTSSM >= 0x10 we still wait for a delay before
considering the link up (because I suppose, after asking a retraining
it takes a while for the LTSSM state to become < 0x10), correct ?

You have to comment this code since it is not easy to grasp.
