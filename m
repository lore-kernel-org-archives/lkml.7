It will break things like page protection i am working on (KSM for file
back page). Pages can go through bio for mundane reasons (crypto, network,
gpu, ...) that have nothing to do with I/O for fs and do not have to block
any of the fs operation. If we GUP bias all those pages then we will
effectively make the situation worse in that pages will have a high likely-
hood to always look GUPed while it is just going through some bio for one
of those mundane reasons (and page is not being written to just use as
a source).

I understand why conceptualy it looks appealing but we would be loosing
information here. I really want to be able to determine if a page is GUPed
or not. If we GUP bias everyone in bio then we loose that.

Also i want to point out that the complexity of biasing all page in bio
are much bigger than this patchset it will require changes to all call
site of bio_add_page*() at very least.

Cheers,
Jérôme
