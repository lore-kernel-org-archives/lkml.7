The problem is that those drivers are accessing a resource that does not
exist in practice, it is taken for granted on x86 systems (and on IA64)
because that was an actual bus (actual or emulated) and was made part of
the architecture. The ISA space is not necessarily tied to PCI,
at least not always.

Side note: these drivers can't be compiled on PPC, it would be
good to understand why, I have a hunch it can be related.

Yes, the bottom line is what Arnd outlined in the thread above.

ISA IO port space is not necessarily PCI but it does not exist
architecturally on ARM systems.

Taking the example of IA64, the ISA space is memory mapped (like any
other arch except for x86) but IIUC the virtual mapping for the ISA
port space _always_ exists on IA64 so this issue won't happen.

Arnd pointed out a solution in the thread above but I need to check
if that's feasible.
