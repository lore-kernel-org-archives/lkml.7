Hi Robin, Lorenzo,

Thanks for review and guidance.
AFAIU, conclusion of discussion is, to return error if dma-ranges list
is not sorted.

So that, Can I send a new patch with below change to return error if
dma-ranges list is not sorted?

+static int iova_reserve_pci_windows(struct pci_dev *dev,
                struct iova_domain *iovad)

Please provide your inputs if any more changes required. Thank you,
