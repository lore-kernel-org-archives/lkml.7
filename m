Well my proposal would not require any changes in the API, it would just
require a change to the IDT driver. And the mess in the test tools will
still be a mess.

Yes, but the test drivers were a mess and difficult to follow. Only now
am I realizing that ntb_perf required one too many resources by design,
thus are probably very broken for cases that previously worked because
of it.

Yes, it just feels overly complex to have to do that loop every time.

Ok, you're saying that the user will need to be able to map these ports
somehow to their physical address. I buy that, but NTB transport for
example, doesn't really have any method for this. You just get network
interfaces that will likely be numbered similarly to the logical port
number. But that's a whole other problem that will need to be solved
later when there is multi-port ntb-transport.

Users of the code that are not in upstream do not count. Developers
cannot look at that code and reason about how the API is supposed to be
used. This isn't being judgemental, it's stating a fact: kernel
developers do not like having incomplete code in upstream[1][2]. When it
happens, it just makes the code very hard to maintain and very hard to
develop on. Many developers call this a disaster and commonly call for
the code in question to be removed. I can understand this completely
because I'm facing the exact same issues trying to work with the current
upstream NTB code.

I think wasting one memory window is a no-go and should never have been
merged in the first place. The code originally worked fine in the
situation where you have 2 peers, each with one memory window, and that
needs to be maintained.

Well, frankly, it's a mess right now so we just have to deal with it and
try to find a short term solution to start fixing it. Complexity be damned.

Ok I think, for v3, I'll introduce a logical_port_number helper function
which is essentially the loop you proposed. It's needlessly slow (altho
speed isn't an issue) and ugly but at least, I think, it should be as
close to correct as we can get. Someone else will have to eventually
clean up all the test tools because I suspect they are still broken (but
they at least work for me after my fixup set was merged). I personally
have no interest in working on NTB code anymore unless I am being
contracted to do so.

Yes, well the reason it won't work is because of the current mess which
I don't feel like I should be responsible for sorting out. My code works
 correctly for the existing ntb_transport and I've made a best effort to
get as much multiport support as I feel I can, given the available
infrastructure.
