Yeah, it's really just that we should really just have a simple
paragraph that expresses this makes the codebase do X.

That's why I said: technical details that are worth mentioning.
Sometimes you have controversial bits that are obviously to be
understood in the code but it still might be worth explaining why one
had to do it this way. Like say what we did for the pidfd_send_signal()
thing where we explained why O_PATH is disallowed.

Yeah, but they should. There are people with multiple emails over the
years and they might not necessarily contain their first and last
name. And I don't want to have to mailmap them or sm. Having their names
in there just makes it easier. Also, every single other DCO-*related*
line follows:

Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

This should too. If others are sloppy and allow this, fine. No reason we
should.

get_maintainer.pl is not the last word.

It's often not about someone being a maintainer but whether or not they
have valuable input.

Cool. That really wasn't a "you've done this wrong". It's rather really
just to make sure that everyone who might catch a big f*ck up on our
part has had a chance to tell us so. :)

I guess I should've asked the following:
What happens right now, when you get EPOLLIN on the pidfd and you and
out of ignorance you do:

read(pidfd, ...)
