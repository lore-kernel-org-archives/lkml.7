OK, but then you are running in errors=continue mode, aren't you? Because
otherwise the filesystem would get remounted read-only or panic the system
on the first metadata IO error.

Well, this never worked reliably (e.g. the buffer may get evicted due to
memory pressure after IO error) and never was promised to work. Once you
hit the first metadata error, all bets are off, you have to unmount the
filesystem and run fsck. Sure the damage would be likely smaller if we kept
the buffer uptodate in your case but it isn't guaranteed the filesystem
will not get corrupted. But as I said, changing this is not just a matter
of deleting those two clear_buffer_uptodate() calls...

Yes, uptodate means the buffer is valid and newer than disk. However after
IO error, it isn't clear what the actual disk state is. But generally I'm
not opposed to the change you suggest, just it means you have to first go
and check all filesystems using buffer heads and verify that none of them
uses buffer_uptodate() check to detect buffer write failure.
