But why would the ability to access all memory be necessary or even
useful? When would the host access memory that the driver didn't tell it
to access?

I rephrased it in terms of address translation. What do you think of
this version? The flag name is slightly different too:


VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM_NO_TRANSLATION This feature has the same
    meaning as VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM both when set and when not set,
    with the exception that address translation is guaranteed to be
    unnecessary when accessing memory addresses supplied to the device
    by the driver. Which is to say, the device will always use physical
    addresses matching addresses used by the driver (typically meaning
    physical addresses used by the CPU) and not translated further. This
    flag should be set by the guest if offered, but to allow for
    backward-compatibility device implementations allow for it to be
    left unset by the guest. It is an error to set both this flag and
    VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.

They don't use encrypted memory, but a host machine will run a mix of
secure and legacy guests. And since the hypervisor doesn't know whether
a guest will be secure or not at the time it is launched, legacy guests
will have to be launched with the same configuration as secure guests.

That's good to know. Thanks for this example.
