"native_mode" is different but doesn't contain any additional
information.  I haven't worked out what this new symbol actually does;
if it's related to EDR, maybe that could be incorporated somehow?

Right.  As a courtesy to the reader, I think it's worth making
the comment match the code, i.e., you can't pass an event type to
acpi_install_notify_handler(), so obviously the handler will be called
for *all* System events.  By saying "one of which is the EDR event",
you give the reader a hint that the handler will have to filter out
the others.

The reason I noticed this is because I read "Register notifier for EDR
event" and wondered to myself "Hmmm, how does this work?  I don't see
anything passed to acpi_install_notify_handler() that would identify
an EDR event."

Yeah, I'm just saying that conditional is starting to look pretty
gnarly.  Possibly there's nothing to do about it.
