It depends.

For virtio-net, we need to specify the number of available vectors on qemu side,
e.g.,:

-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=tapnet,mq=true,vectors=16

This parameter is specific for virtio-net.

Suppose if 'queues=8' while 'vectors=16', as 2*8+1 > 16, there will be lack of
vectors and guest would not be able to assign one vector for each queue.

I was tortured by this long time ago and it seems qemu would minimize the memory
allocation and the default 'vectors' is 3.

BTW, why cannot we have a more consistent configuration for most qemu devices,
e.g., so far:

virtio-blk use 'num-queues'
nvme use 'num_queues'
virtio-net use 'queues' for tap :)

Yes: virtio-blk and virtio-scsi.

As mentioned above, we need to specify 'vectors' for virtio-net as the default
value is only 3 (config + tx + rx). That would make a little difference?
