It might be workable but i am not sure it is any simpler. bio_add_page*()
does not take page reference it is up to the caller to take the proper
page reference so the complexity would be push there (just in a different
place) so i don't think it would be any simpler. This means that we would
have to update more code than this patchset does.

This present patch is just a coccinelle semantic patch and even if it
is scary to see that many call site, they are not that many that need
to worry about the GUP parameter and they all are in patch 11, 12, 13
and 14.

So i believe this patchset is simpler than converting everyone to take
a GUP like page reference. Also doing so means we loose the information
about GUP kind of defeat the purpose. So i believe it would be better
to limit special reference to GUP only pages.

Cheers,
Jérôme
