Hi again Bjorn.

I didn't know that was your idea.  Good idea.

Great, that's sensible.

Also very sensible.

Generically, yes.

I have a little script that does the equivalent of:

<git reset>
make <foo.o>
mv <foo.o> <foo.o>.old
patch -P1 < <foo_patch>
make <foo.o>
mv <foo.o> <foo.o>.new
diff -urN <(objdump -d <foo.o>.old) <(objdump -d <foo.o>.new)

But it's not foolproof as gcc does not guarantee
compilation repeatability.

And some subsystems Makefiles do not allow per-file
compilation.
