Perhaps userland could register a helper that takes over and does
something better?  But I think the kernel really should do something
vaguely reasonable all by itself.  If nothing else, we want the ext4
patch that provoked this whole discussion to be applied, which means
that we need to unbreak userspace somehow, and returning garbage it to
is not a good choice.

Here are some possible approaches that come to mind:

int count;
while (crng isn't inited) {
  msleep(1);
}

and modify add_timer_randomness() to at least credit a tiny bit to
crng_init_cnt.

Or we do something like intentionally triggering readahead on some
offset on the root block device.  We should definitely not trigger
*blocking* IO.

Also, I wonder if the real problem preventing the RNG from staring up
is that the crng_init_cnt threshold is too high.  We have a rather
baroque accounting system, and it seems like we can accumulate and
credit entropy for a very long time indeed without actually
considering ourselves done.
