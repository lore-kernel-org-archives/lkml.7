We already have plumbing to make pwritev2 and AIO issue FUA writes
via the RWF_DSYNC flag through the fs/iomap.c direct IO path. FUA is
only valid if the file does not have dirty metadata (e.g. because of
block allocation) and that requires the filesystem block mapping to
tell the IO path if FUA can be used. Otherwise a journal flush is
also required to make the data stable and there's no point in doing
a FUA write for the data in that case...

Cheers,

Dave.
