"I can use this kernel or CPU feature to do something unpleasant that
I could do anyway, if less nicely" is a far cry from "known and
documented security issues".

We've hashed this out to death.  Once SGX is upstream, feel free to
submit patches.

As I understand it, Cedric is going to submit a patch for this
shortly, assuming I have correctly guessed what supposed ABI break
you're talking about.

In the mean time, I need to correct you on a critical point.  Linux
has *never* had a policy that it will retain compatibility with an API
that wasn't upstream in the first place.

[removed extensive verbiage.  Dr. Greg, if you want your emails to be

less.]

I just spend several minutes trying to read your code.  It would
benefit dramatically from some attempt at documentation, and, at the
very least, you can't have a function foo(type *ptr) that does
something almost completely different when ptr == NULL and when ptr !=
NULL.  For a concrete example, consider sgx_launch_control().  If you
pass NULL, then there's a vaguely credible argument that the function
does what the name suggests.  If you pass non-NULL, it doesn't.  The
result is bug-prone and unreadable.

If I'm understanding it right, it causes the SGX ABI to be almost
completely incompatible between the case where the list of launch
signers is empty and the case where the list is non-empty.  This is a
non-starter.  We're also extensively discussed how launch enclaves
would be supported if we were to support them, and the generally
agreed-upon solution was that the *kernel* would handle running a
launch enclave.  Jarkko even has code for this, but it's tabled until
someone comes up with a credible argument that we *want* to support
launch enclaves.

No it doesn't, because it requires the application (or its runtime or
SDK or whatever) to bundle the launch enclave that implements the
fancy policy, which means that the platform owner actually can't swap
out the policy without breaking all the applications.  This is the
primary reason that, if Linux were to support LE-based launch control,
it would do so in the kernel.

A sufficiently careful administrator who wants to protect against
enclave malware might want the ability to revoke permission to run a
specific enclave, which your approach can't do.  Again, this has all
been covered extensively.

To be crystal clear, i fully agree that we are likely to eventually
want some kind of in-kernel launch policy.  But I don't think that
defining such a policy should block the upstreaming of the driver, and
I don't think that your proposal for how the policy should work is an
acceptable proposal.
