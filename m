It looks like a problem with your xHCI USB host controller.  Normally a
usb-storage transfer would be aborted after 90 seconds.  But if the
host controller (or its driver) isn't working right, and the abort
never completes, you end up with a situation like this -- usb-storage
and the higher SCSI and block layers waiting indefinitely for an event
that won't occur.

In theory, unplugging the USB mass-storage device would unblock
everything (unless xhci-hcd is too badly wedged).  But of course, doing
that is likely to mess up whatever you were working on.
