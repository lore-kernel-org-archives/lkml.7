The code change seems to add a check for the window size, I see no
notion of 64 vs 32 bit addressing there so I am pretty sure there is
something you are not telling me that is implicit in the IProc outbound
window configuration, for instance why is the lowest index window
considered for 32-bit.

AFAICS you are adding code to allow a window whose size is < than
the lowest index in the ob_map array. How this relates to 64 vs
32 bit addresses is not clear but it should be.

When I read your commit log it is impossible to understand how it
correlates to the code you are changing - I still have not figured it
out myself.

Please explain in detail to me how this works, forget DT changes I
want to understand how HW works.
