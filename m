Right, and this is what I am attempting to do here.

So today a call to request_muxed_region() can still succeed even if no 
IO space mapped.

As such, even well-behaved drivers like f71882fg can still crash the 
system, as noted in RFC patch 1/4 ("resource: Request IO port regions 
from children of ioport_resource").

John
