AFAIU the spec and what I heard from Nvidia hardware folks is that spec doesn't
explicitly talk about this and it was a design choice made by Nvidia hardware
folks to route these interrupts through legacy line instead of MSI line.

I think it is time I give some background about why I chose to implement
.runtime_suspend() and .runtime_resume() APIs in the first place. We wanted to
powerdown PCIe controller if there is no link up (i.e. slot is open and no endpoint
devices are connected). We want to achieve this without returning a failure in
.probe() call. Given PCIe IP power partitioning is handled by generic power domain
framework, power partition gets unpowergated before .probe() gets called and gets
powergated either when a failure is returned in .probe() or when pm_runtime_put_sync()
is called. So, I chose to call pm_runtime_put_sync() in no-link-up scenario and chose
to implement .runtime_suspend() to handle all the cleanup work before PCIe partition
getting powergated. In fact, to match this, I'm doing all the PCIe IP bring up
activity in .runtime_resume() implementation which gets invoked by pm_runtime_get_sync()
which in turn is called in .probe() path. In fact the very dw_pcie_host_init() itself
is called from .runtime_resume() implementation. So, it is because of these reasons that
I called pci_stop_root_bus() and pci_remove_root_bus() as part of .runtime_suspend()
implementation as pm_runtime_put_sync() is called from both .remove() and also during
no-link-up scenario. Please do let me know if there is a better way to do this.
