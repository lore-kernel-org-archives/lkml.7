Ok so i had to read everything and i should have read everything before
asking all of the above. It does look good in fact, what worried my in
this patch is all the lockdep avoidance as it is usualy a red flags.

But after thinking long and hard i do not see how to easily solve that

in this patch is the most sane thing. Sorry for the noise.

So for this patch:
