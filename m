I agree, but the context of this discussion is whether it is
more appropriate to check fc == 0x03 in this function or the pqap
hook. If there is no vfio_ap module, which Pierre asked me to consider,
then there will be no hook initialized. Again, nothing Pierre has
stated has convinced me that the fc check belongs here, although there
is no harm in doing so. In fact, a malicious guest can issue PQAP(AQIC)
with fc=0x03, so none of the arguments above makes sense in this
context.

The pqap hook IS the instruction handler. Everything up to the point of
calling the hook is validation code. Since the pqap hook is the entity
that actually handles the instruction, it seem to me logical that it
would be the place to parse the sub-function (i.e., fc) of the
PQAP instruction. That is the essence of my argument. I've stated
several sound reasons for asking for the change. Having said that, if
you all feel strongly that it belongs here, no harm done. As the Beatles
once said, let it be.

That all sounds correct assuming we will never do interception of other
AP instructions in KVM.

I think this debate has gone on far too long for such a minor
suggestion. If Pierre wants to keep the check for fc here, so be
it. I've wasted waaaaaay to much time on it.
