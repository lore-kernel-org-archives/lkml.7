No, I was confused: "\n" is non-printable according to isprint(), so
ESCAPE_ANY_NP *will* escape it.  So this isn't quite so bad.  SSIDs are
usually printed as '%*pE', so arguably we should be escaping the single
quote character too, but at least we're not allowing line breaks
through.  I don't know about non-ascii.

And same here, this is OK.
