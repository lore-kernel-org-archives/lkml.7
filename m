I do not see it that simple. Forcing livepatched modules to be
loaded would mean loading "random" new modules when updating
livepatches:

  + It means more actions and higher risk to destabilize
    the system. Different modules have different quality.

  + It might open more security holes that are not fixed by
    the livepatch.

  + It might require some extra configuration actions to handle
    the newly opened interfaces (devices). For example, updating
    SELinux policies.

  + Are there conflicting modules that might need to get
    livepatched?

This approach has a strong no-go from my side.

Yes, this would just move the problem somewhere else.

I see this just as a particular approach how to split livepatches
per-object. The above points suggest how to handle dependencies
on the kernel side.

The problem might be how to transition all loaded objects atomically
when the needed code is loaded from different modules.

Alternative would be to support only per-object consitency. But it
might reduce the number of supported scenarios too much. Also it
would make livepatching more error-prone.


I would like to see updated variant of this patch to see how much
arch-specific code is really necessary.

IMHO, if reverting relocations is too complicated then the least painful
compromise is to "deny the patched modules to be removed".
