If the interrupt is managed yes.

That was the constraint of managed interrupts from the very beginning:

  The driver/subsystem has to quiesce the interrupt line and the associated
  queue _before_ it gets shutdown in CPU unplug and not fiddle with it
  until it's restarted by the core when the CPU is plugged in again.
