Your logic would apply to IOMMUs as well.  For your mode, there are
specific encrypted memory regions that driver has access to but device
does not. that seems to violate the constraint.

I think so. The spec says "device has same access as driver".

It looks kind of narrow but it's an option.
I wonder how we'll define what's an iommu though.

Another idea is maybe something like virtio-iommu?

IIUC that's really because on pSeries IOMMU is *always* turned on.
Platform has no way to say what you want it to say
which is bypass the iommu for the specific device.
