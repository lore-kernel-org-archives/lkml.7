Subject: [PATCH v2 00/13] Prepare syscall_get_arch for PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO
Message-ID: <20190317232827.GA16301@altlinux.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline

syscall_get_arch() is required to be implemented on all architectures in order
to extend the generic ptrace API with PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request:
syscall_get_arch() is going to be called from ptrace_request() along with
syscall_get_nr(), syscall_get_arguments(), syscall_get_error(), and
syscall_get_return_value() functions with a tracee as their argument.

The primary intent is that the triple (audit_arch, syscall_nr, arg1..arg6)
should describe what system call is being called and what its arguments are.

This patchset began as a series called "Prepare for PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO",
then I merged it into a series called "ptrace: add PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request"
that also contains ptrace-specific changes.

The ptrace-specific part, however, needs more attention to workaround problems
on niche architectures like alpha, while the syscall_get_arch() part is
straightforward, so I decided to split it out into a separate patchset that
just prepares syscall_get_arch() for PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO: it adds
syscall_get_arch() to those architectures that haven't implemented it yet,
and then adds "struct task_struct *" argument to syscall_get_arch()
on all architectures.

All patches from this patchset have been already reviewed, so it's ready
to be merged without waiting for the ptrace-specific part.  As it's all
about syscall_get_arch(), it should probably go via audit tree.

Notes:
    v2: rebased to v5.1-rc1, added Acked-by
