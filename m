Subject: [PATCH v17] i2c: Add drivers for the AMD PCIe MP2 I2C controller
Message-ID: <20190305151319.GA22819@syn-yoga530>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.9.4 (2018-02-28)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

MP2 controllers have two separate busses, so may accommodate up to two I2C
adapters. Those adapters are listed in the ACPI namespace with the
"AMDI0011" HID, and probed by a platform driver.

Communication with the MP2 takes place through MMIO registers, or through
DMA for more than 32 bytes transfers.

This is major rework of the patch submitted by Nehal-bakulchandra Shah from
AMD (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10597369/).

Most of the event handling of v3 was rewritten to make it work with more
than one bus (e.g on Ryzen-based Lenovo Yoga 530), and this version
contains many other improvements.

Changes since v1 (https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-i2c/msg34650.html):
-> Add fix for IOMMU
-> Add dependency of ACPI
-> Add locks to avoid the crash

Changes since v2 (https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/961270/):

-> fix for review comments
-> fix for more than 32 bytes write issue

Changes since v3 (https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10597369/) by Elie M.:

-> support more than one bus/adapter
-> support more than one slave per bus
-> use the bus speed specified by the slaves declared in the DSDT instead of
   assuming speed == 400kbits/s
-> instead of kzalloc'ing a buffer for every less than 32 bytes reads, simply
   use i2c_msg.buf
-> fix buffer overreads/overflows when (<=32 bytes) message lengths aren't a
   multiple of 4 by using memcpy_fromio and memcpy_toio
-> use streaming DMA mappings instead of allocating a coherent DMA buffer for
   every >32 bytes read/write
-> properly check for timeouts during i2c_amd_xfer and increase it from 50
   jiffies to 250 msecs (which is more in line with other drivers)
-> complete amd_i2c_dev.msg even if the device doesn't return a xxx_success
   event, instead of stalling i2c_amd_xfer
-> removed the spinlock and mdelay during i2c_amd_pci_configure, I didn't see
   the point since it's already waiting for a i2c_busenable_complete event
-> add an adapter-specific mutex lock for i2c_amd_xfer, since we don't want
   parallel calls writing to AMD_C2P_MSG0 (or AMD_C2P_MSG1)
-> add a global mutex lock for registers AMD_C2P_MSG2 to AMD_C2P_MSG9,  which
   are shared across the two busses/adapters
-> add MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE to automatically load i2c-amd-platdrv if the DSDT
   enumerates devices with the "AMDI0011" HID
-> set maximum length of reads/writes to 4095 (event's length field is 12 bits)
-> basic PM support
-> style corrections to match the kernel code style, and tried to reduce code
   duplication whenever possible

Changes since v4 by Elie M.:

-> fix missing typecast warning
-> removed the duplicated entry in Kconfig

Changes since v5 by Elie M.:

-> move DMA mapping from the platform driver to the PCI driver
-> attempt to find the platform device's PCI parent through the _DEP ACPI method
   (if not found take the first MP2 device registred in the i2c-amd-pci-mp2
   driver, like before)
-> do not assume anymore that the PCI device is owned by the i2c-amd-pci-mp2
   driver
-> address other review comments by Bjorn Helgaas (meant for v3)

Changes since v6 by Elie M.:

-> remove unnecessary memcpy from the DMA buffer during i2c_amd_read_completion

Changes since v7 by Elie M.:

-> merge the two modules into one named i2c-amd-mp2, delete now useless exports
-> unlock the C2P mutex if i2c_amd_xfer_msg timeouts, to prevent stalling the
   MP2 controller if a slave doesn't respond to a read or write request
-> unmap the DMA buffer before read/write_complete
-> fix bus_disable commands handling (no more errors during module exit)
-> prefer managed versions of pci_ and dev_ functions whenever possible
-> increase adapter retries from 0 to 3
-> reduce code duplication in debugfs functions
-> address other review points by Bjorn Helgaas (except regarding the _DEP
   hint)

Changes since v8 by Elie M.:

-> remove mostly redundant amd_i2c_rw_config, refer to i2c_msg whenever
possible
-> use i2c_get_dma_safe_msg_buf and i2c_put_dma_safe_msg_buf
-> defer probe() by the platform driver if no MP2 device has been probed
yet by the PCI driver (which should address Bjorn Helgaas' concern while
preserving the platform driver)
-> if the interrupt following a command doesn't get handled after 250ms,
zero AMD_P2C_MSG_INTEN to prevent the MP2 from stalling for a few more
seconds
-> include AMD_P2C_MSG3 and fix typo in debugfs output
-> cosmetic fixes, code reduction, and better comments
-> add Nehal Shah and Shyam Sundar S K from AMD to the list of maintainers

Changes since v9 by Elie M.:

-> remove the xfer_lock mutex which was redundant with i2c_adapter.bus_lock
-> platform device remove() fixes (protection against the very unlikely
case that both the PCI and platform devices get detached manually and
simultaneously)
-> fix manually unbinding the PCI device and then rebinding, there was an
interrupt that wouldn't get serviced and thus the line got disabled
-> look for the MP2 device corresponding to an AMDI0011 ACPI device in
every device enumerated by _DEP, not just the first one
-> set i2c_adapter.nr to pdev->id and call i2c_add_numbered_adapter()
-> add Documentation/i2c/busses/ entry
-> minor enhancements

Changes since v10 by Elie M.:

-> runtime PM support
-> synchronisation fixes for <=32 bytes reads/writes through C2P registers,
no more timeouts or "irq: nobody cared" errors on Lenovo Ideapad 530s
-> remove the isr spinlock, not needed since isr aren't re-entrant
-> remove the delayed_work field, make the isr complete .cmd_complete
directly
-> xfer now returns -EIO if the MP2 response isn't the expected one
-> check that the adapter still exists at the beginning of xfer
-> less code duplication in amd_mp2_read/write
-> better names (bus_xnable => bus_enable_set, _msg => _cmd) and other
minor enhancements

Changes since v11 by Elie M.:

-> remove the ACPI _DEP hint, Nehal from AMD said that there's no plan to
have more than one MP2 device per system and this wasn't _DEP's purpose
-> use device links between the two drivers to simplify the .remove logic
-> do not hardcode the i2c adapter timeout
-> code reduction and comment fixes

Changes since v12 by Elie M.:

-> fix the two warnings by the kbuild test bot

Changes since v13 by Elie M., requested by Nehal Shah from AMD:

-> split the i2c-amd-mp2 module back into two, i2c-amd-mp2-pci and
i2c-amd-mp2-plat
-> move DMA mapping back into the platform driver

Changes since v14 by Elie M.:

-> fix build failure if CONFIG_PM isn't defined

Changes since v15 by Elie M.:

-> changes requested by Wolfram Sang in his v15 review

Changes since v16 by Elie M.:

-> ensure that writeq gets defined
-> fix the device name in Documentation/ to match the entry at pci-ids (https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/read/PC/1022/15e6)
-> remove the unused DRIVER_xxx defines (forgot to remove them in v16)
