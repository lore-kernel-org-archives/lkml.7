Yes, and I've played with the parameters quite a bit.

Sorry if I'm being unduly dense, but then how to enable debugging
during early boot? The only other alternative I see is modifying the
initrd, and asking folks to do that is noticeably more complicated
than having them add something to the command line in grub. So from my
perspective I find kernel params far from old-school :-)

I have read it (we're talking about the dynamic debug docs here), but
I just don't see how it addresses this in any way.

Thanks for the hint, I hadn't paid much attention to tracepoints till
now. They do solve most of these issues I've mentioned here, though.
So I've actually gone and implemented the tracing as tracepoints now.
Two issues I noticed though:

 1. since filters can't be enabled on the command line (and yes, we
    seem to disagree on the usefulness of the command line) it means
    I had to essentially create tracepoints for every trace+filter
    combo I may want to enable (in my case it's just one field, so I
    ended up with 8 tracepoints instead of 1). Not a big deal in my
    case, but could get ugly.

 2. in cases where there is relevant log output too, folks have to be
    told to provide both trace and dmesg output, the outputs have to
    merged back together again. Though I note that with the use of the
    tp_printk kernel param this inconvenience goes away again (but
    we're back to logging the traces in the kernel log :-) ).

The tracepoints do indeed cover this too.
