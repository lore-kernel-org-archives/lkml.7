No need to worry, I'm fully aware of all this.

Like I said, this patch series is an RFC, the mount option was suggested
by Amir and Miklos, so I assumed showing some code is a good base for further
discussion.
For most of *my* use-cases it works but having general support for fscrypt+overlayfs
would be the ultimate goal.
