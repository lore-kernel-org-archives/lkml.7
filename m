I think that's what I suggested to do.

That should be fine. I don't think it will crash those tools, they will
just give out wrong information, and if people complain, we can try to
get them to use the newer version of those tools ;-) (hopefully they
don't complain to Linus).

I'm fine with the switch, as long as newer tools know how to handle it.

Make sure we also add a comment in the Linux kernel code that states
that older kernels use to have 'f' and 'F' and that new tools look for
'fw' to denote that this isn't an older kernel. This way, people will
hopefully not add another 'fX' pointer name.
