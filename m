>=20

Two main things:
1) Lack of generality of the approach.=20
   This is a single use trick for input devices. Why does it make sense for
   input devices?  There are lots of other in kernel users and potential
   ones in the future.  The ability to register additional IIO consumers li=
ke
   this is useful, lets make it useful to everyone.

2) To much generality of the specific usecase.  I don't want to put an Input
   interface on accelerometers where it makes no sense.  The rule of it has
   2-3 axis so it must make sense isn't good enough to my mind.  How
   does userspace know which accelerometer to use (more and more devices ha=
ve
   multiple?)  You could do something like looking at the location info from
   DT / ACPI in your driver and pick the 'best' but that's policy. Should be
   in userspace.  Sure you can just use the right input driver, but the mom=
ent
   we do that, we need aware userspace, if that's the case why not make it
   aware from the start.

Believe me I've been round this one a good few times and thought about it
a lot.  I'll take a lot of convincing that this isn't a problem that
should be pushed into userspace.

The bytes don't really mater. The userspace ABI additions do.

Agreed, in the ideal case we wouldn't have had that either, but we are
stuck with it.  The long term plan is to allow use of IIO backends without =
the
front end being there at all. Lots of SoC ADC users would prefer this. We a=
re
stuck with the legacy intertwining fo the front end and back end of IIO so
this isn't as easy to do as I would like.

That argument does not apply. If we add a config option, distros will enabl=
e it.
So the vast majority of systems will ship with this turned on.  You cannot
use a config variable to control policy and expect it to be change by anyone
but a very very small subset of users.  So please drop the 'you can just not
build it argument'.

Userspace configuration changing is a lot easier if people actually care.
Sure, many distros will ship the same script to everyone.

Trivial resources and actually fairly trivial complexity.  Key thing is
it puts the burden on the users of this functionality to configure what they
want.

Agreed, we just have a different view on how this should be done. I want
it to be dynamic and extremely flexible, you want the easy way of just
putting a fixed set out all the time.

Or, you an have the correct 'fairly trivial' userspace setup to scan for all
registered accelerometers and 'on demand' create the bindings to bring them=
 up as
Input accelerometers if that is what makes sense for your platform.

No more that it needs to know which accelerometer to use?

No. Let me give some more details of how this would work.  It's really just
a more flexible version of what you have.

A distro, or individual user decides to put the relevant script in place fo=
r the
following:

1. Userspace detects a new accelerometer driver, via the standard methods (=
uevent)
2. Userspace looks to see if it has the required properties. Now this inclu=
des things
like detecting that it is the accelerometer in the lid of a laptop - if so =
do not
register it as an input device.  If it's in the keyboard then do register i=
t.
3. Userspace script then creates the files in configfs
/sys/kernel/config/iio/maps/
(this interface needs appropriate definition)
Maybe...
/sys/kernel/config/iio/maps/iio_input/iio_device:X/accel_x, accel_y, etc
When done it writes to the bind file
/sys/kernel/config/iio/maps/iio_input/iio_device:X/bind
which instantiates the input driver.

This moves all of the policy decision into userspace, where it belongs.  If
we want to enable a particular accelerometer on a particular board because =
it
actually works better than the one the default policy says to use, then we =
can
do so.

The resulting infrastructure is much more general, because it lets us do the
same for any IIO consumer.  This input bridge is not a special case. It wor=
ks
equally well for the existing hwmon bridge any would even let us do things
like provide the information from userspace that we have an analog accelero=
meter
wired up to an ADC on some hacker board.

See above. It's not the input accelerometer ABI, it's the missing ability
to instantiate IIO maps from user space.

Yes we should. You are proposing a solution that is a subset of the larger
problem set.  Why introduce a stop gap like this when we can do it correctly
and provide something useful for all those other use cases.

The only difference here is the uevent triggered script that creates those =
maps
for your particular usecase.

That is true for the narrow case you are talking about. I don't want to see=
 that
narrow case solved in a fashion that effectively breaks solving it properly.
If we add this, we have to export all accelerometers for ever under all cir=
cumstances
to userspace, because to remove it will break existing userspace.

If we stand back and work out if we can do the general solution now, we avo=
id
this problem.

Hmm. I can see we perhaps need some mapping, but is there a concept of stan=
dard scale
for existing input accelerometers?  How is this done to give for other inpu=
t devices
such as touch screens?  I'd expect to see a separation between scale, and r=

Agreed, it needs to be hardware independent by the time it hits userspace, =
but I would
have thought that scaling would be done in input, rather than IIO. It's har=
dly
a problem unique to our usecase!

Perhaps Dmitry can give some advice on this.

Use fixed size. The worst that happens is we end up with it being
an entry larger that it needs to be.

Well we disagree on this.  A singleton approach like used here
is to my mind not KISS.  I would rather see what is there then
act as two simple steps, rather than interleave two different
actions with a totally different path for the first channel found.
If there is only one channel you just built a load of infrastructure
that makes no sense.  If you scan first then you can know that
before building anything.
