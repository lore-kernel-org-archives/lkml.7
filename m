Hi Tom,

Thanks for doing this!

Note, I'm marking this as TODO, as the merge window has opened and this
will have to wait till it closes. But that means it may get buried by
other patches and such marked as TODO. :-p

Can you send me a friendly reminder in two weeks if you don't hear from
me?

Thanks!
