Thanks for the update.

Sorry but adding new implementations of chacha20/poly1305 without
removing the existing ones is not acceptable.  I really think
we ought to separate the zinc interface from these new crypto
implementations.  They have nothing to do with each other.

As we've been stuck on this point for so long, let's get the
ball rolling by first merging just the zinc interface itself
with the existing chacha20/poly1305 code.  Then we can replace
these implementations with your implementations without getting
bogged down by all these other discussions.

AFAICS once we resolve Thomas's concerns with regards to the simd
patch, then we can merge the zinc interface right away and go from
there.

Cheers,
