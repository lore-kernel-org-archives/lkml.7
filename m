Well, another problem is that it almost certainly doesn't actually work, because
some plaintext will still be recoverable from disk or the raw flash.  Actually
erasing data on modern filesystems and storage devices is extremely difficult.
To start, you'd have to run BLKSECDISCARD on every single block ever written to
disk to prepare the container, or written by the container during its execution.

That's one reason to use storage encryption: it reduces the secure deletion
problem to just erasing the encryption key.

fscrypt doesn't support backup and restore without the key, so no you can't do
that.  But there wouldn't be much benefit for doing it that way anyway, since
you'd still have to untar the container image each time the container is
started, then re-tar it each time the container is stopped.

The container image could be an ext4 filesystem image containing an encrypted
directory, in which case the container could be run directly from the image.
But in that case, dm-crypt would be a better choice.

I am just stating the facts.  Storage encryption only solves a specific set of
problems, not every problem.  There has already been a huge amount of effort
into developing OS-level access control mechanisms in Linux, so fscrypt does not
duplicate that; it just does storage encryption.
