On Arm, the kernel may use either FPSIMD or SVE (if supported by the 
platform). While the FPSIMD context is fairly small (~4K), the SVE 
context can be up to ~64KB.

This is a fair point. However, the use of crypto in softirqs seem to be 
limited. So I am wondering whether disabling softirq in all the case is 
worth it.

Would it be possible to consider to forbid/warn about using crypto in 
softirqs?

I was able to find my way through mac80211 and confirm the use a taslket 
and therefore softirqs. However, I got lost in the ipsec code.

This is the same on the platform I have been using for testing.
