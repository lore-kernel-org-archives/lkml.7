It does for those with a unique number.

It will be alongside other I/O operations in the pidfd man page.

Consider if we were to do:

int procpidfd_open(int pidfd, int procrootfd);

This system call is useless besides a very specific operation for a
very specific usecase on a file descriptor. Then, you figure you might
want to support procpidfd back to pidfd (although YAGNI), so you will
add a CMD or flags argument now,

int procpidfd_open(int pidfd, int procrootfd/procpidfd, unsigned int flags);

  int procpidfd = procpidfd_open(fd, procrootfd, PIDFD_TO_PROCPIDFD);
  int pidfd = procpidfd_open(-1, procpidfd, PROCPIDFD_TO_PIDFD);

vs procpidfd2pidfd(int procpidfd); if you did not foresee the need.
Then, you want pidfd2pid, and so on.

If you don't, you will have to add a command interface in the new
system call, which changes parameters depending on the flags. This is
already starting to get ugly. In the end, it's a matter of taste, this
pattern if exploited leads to endless proliferation of the system call
interface, often ridden with short-sighted APIs, because you cannot
know if you want a focused call or a command style call. ioctl is
already a command interface, and 10 system calls for each command is
_NOT_ nice, from a user perspective.

It is well defined, it has a well defined signature, and it will error
out if you don't use it properly. Again, what it does is very limited
and niche. I am not sure it warrants a system call of its own.

timerfd_gettime was an afterthought anyway, that's probably not a good
example (it was more to just match the POSIX timers interface as the
original timerfd never had support for querying, so the split into two
steps, create and initialize, you could argue one could do it without
a syscall, but it still has a well defined argument list, and
accepting elaborate data structures into an ioctl is not a good
interface to plumb, so that's easily justified).

It's much like socket and setsockopt/getsockopt in nature. I would
even say APIs separating creation and configuration age well and are
better, but a process doesn't fit such a model cleanly.

On that note, I don't buy the safety argument here, or the seccomp argument.

You need to consider what this is, on a case by case basis.

ioctl(pidfd, PIDFD_TO_PROCFD, procrootfd);

See? You need /proc's root fd to be able to get to the /proc/<PID> dir
fd, in a race free manner. You don't need to have the overhead of
filtering to contain access, as privilege is bound to descriptors.

However, an ioctl to do pidfd_send_signal would have indeed been
problematic, it takes in structures, it has a very core use case, and
a very compelling advantage over existing signal sending APIs.

On the point, using file descriptors, you can safely delegate metadata
access to a process it has a pidfd open for, without /proc being in
its mount namespace (which was what Andy was after). File descriptors
are acting as capabilities, so if you don't leak the /proc's root fd
to the process, you can be assured it wouldn't be able to do any
metadata access (and you don't have /proc mounted).

*No need* to blacklist the ioctl or the system call, as it wouldn't
work anyway. *This* is a good interface, with little to no overhead
for security. So whether this is an ioctl or a system call doesn't
matter at all, because it doesn't suffer from all those cases where
you really want to avoid ioctls and do a well scoped system call as an
entrypoint instead.

There is not much incentive to it, really.
