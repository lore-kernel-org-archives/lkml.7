I don't understand what you mean by "normal". As I said, I tend to have a x86_64 ABI compliant version and by saying that I mean it'd be a 100% "normal" function callable from C. And the version I provided in this thread is a trimmed down version that doesn't preserve any registers except RSP/RBP so a C wrapper will be necessary. Other than that I'm not aware of any anomalies. Could you elaborate on what "abnormal" operations necessary to invoke this vDSO under what circumstances? And it'll be very helpful if you could present a "normal" function to demonstrate how your code could work with it while mine couldn't.

If you want to bike-shedding on *must*, well, no one *must* use *anything* from the *anyone*! But is that the expectation? Or if you don't expect your API to be used then what are you doing here?

Intel SDK doesn't have to use this API. But we (the SDK team) are truly willing to use this API because we share the same concern with you over signals and would like to move to something better.

Disagreed! What I'm proposing is one ABI - enclave preserves RBP! No requirements on RSP. Of course RSP is still interpreted as the line between vacant and used parts of the stack, or nothing will work regardless the proposal.

The hosting process may have an agreement with the enclave to preserve RSP. But that would be completely between them, and would be just a coincidence instead of a consequence of the ABI from the perspective of this vDSO API.

Disagreed! We share the same concern over signals so let's work this out!

The unwanders use CFI directives to determine frame pointers. RSP is the frame point by default but could be easily changed - e.g. by ".cfi_def_cfa_register %rbp". I could add proper CFI directives if so desired. I omitted them because you omitted them too in your code (in case you don't know, CFI directives are needed around push/pop %rcx in your code to stay compliant with ELF/DWARF spec), and I didn't want to confuse those who didn't understand CFI.

Well, technically speaking an ABI compliant API should *reduce* documentation. But given how easy it is to write a C compliant wrapper, I think a custom ABI is perfectly fine.
