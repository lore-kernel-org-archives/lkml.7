A good number of them are no longer valid. So I'm not sure it's worth
updating them en masse to addresses that won't ever work.

We have git now, we don't need email addresses in files, they're just
prone to bitrot like this.

Should we just change them all like so?

  -arch/powerpc/boot/dts/bamboo.dts: * Josh Boyer <jwboyer@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
  +arch/powerpc/boot/dts/bamboo.dts: * Josh Boyer (IBM)


To indicate the author was at IBM when they wrote it?

Or should we try and update them with current addresses? Though then the
authors might start getting mails they don't want.

cheers
