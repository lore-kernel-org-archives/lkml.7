Correct me if I'm wrong, but there seem to be two kinds of limitations
involved here:
- Allocation of msix vectors by the virtio-pci transport. We end up
  with shared vectors if we have more virtqueues than vcpus. Other
  transports may or may not have similar issues, but essentially, this
  is something that applies to all kind of virtio devices attached via
  the virtio-pci transport.
- The block layer limits the number of hw queues to the number of
  vcpus. This applies only to virtio devices that interact with the
  block layer, but regardless of the virtio transport.

Ok, the hw queues limit from above would be an argument to limit to
#vcpus in the virtio-blk driver, regardless of the transport used. (No
idea if there are better ways to deal with this, I'm not familiar with
the interface.)

For virtio devices that don't interact with the block layer and are
attached via the virtio-pci transport, it might still make sense to
revisit vector allocation.
