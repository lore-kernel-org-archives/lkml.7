This version gives me the header files on a v5.0-rc8 kernel on my arm64 
box but does not compile anymore on v4.20:

kernel/kheaders.c:25:22: error: expected identifier or ‘(’ before string 
constant
  #define KH_MAGIC_END "IKHD_ED"
                       ^

  KH_MAGIC_END;
  ^~~~~~~~~~~~
kernel/kheaders.c: In function ‘ikheaders_read_current’:
kernel/kheaders.c:38:12: error: ‘kernel_headers_data’ undeclared (first 
use in this function); did you mean ‘kernel_headers_data_size’?
             kernel_headers_data + KH_MAGIC_SIZE,
             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             kernel_headers_data_size

  }


The reason for me to stay on v4.20 is that with v5.0-rc8 I don't have 
ebpf 'raw tracepoint' support any more on my arm64 board. But this issue 
is not related to your patch though.

Another point which supports the functionality your patch provides is 
the fact that maintainers don't want to see new TRACE_EVENTs in their 
code. So here your patch comes handy when using ebpf for tracing in 
embedded environments.
