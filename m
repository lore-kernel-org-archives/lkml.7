Hi Michel,

Thanks for reviewing this series.

Until we get rid of the mmap_sem which seems to be a very long story, I 
can't see how we could get rid of the retry mechanism.

The only concern is the flow of operation  done in the vm_ops->fault() 
processing. Most of the file system relie on the generic filemap_fault() 
which should be safe to use. But we need a clever way to identify fault 
processing which are compatible with the SPF handler. This could be done 
using a tag/flag in the vm_ops structure or in the vma's flags.

This would be the next step.

I've to admit that I didn't dig further here.
Do you have a patch? ;)

Yes that's the reason, no way to guarantee the value of these fields in 
the SPF path.

I'll have to give it a try.

Thanks a lot for reviewing this long series.
