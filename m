I don't think it is a good behaviour to use bio->bi_max_vecs to limit
max allowed page, you may see the idea from the naming simply...

If there were other such drivers, we may fix it easily, and the following
patch should fix your issue:

One new interface, such as bio_add_page_limit(), may be helpful for
addressing this issue, but not sure if it is necessary, since it is
more reasonable to put the logic in user side.

I'd suggest you to not re-use bio->bi_max_vecs for this purpose.

It isn't necessary, see the above patch.
