I see that you set this to a 256 KiB region for all controllers. Since
each function can have up to 4 KiB of extended configuration space, that
means you have space to address:

    256 KiB =3D 4 KiB * 8 functions * 8 devices

Each bus can have up to 32 devices (including the root port) and there
can be 256 busses, so I wonder how this is supposed to work. How does
the mapping work for configuration space? Does the controller allow
moving this 256 KiB window around so that more devices' configuration
space can be accessed?

This is slightly confusing because you already said in the description
of "window1" that it is used to access the configuration space of the
root port itself.

Is the root port configuration space available via the regular
configuration space registers?

It's redundant to name a clock _clk. Is this already required by the
standard Designware bindings or is this new?

Same comment as for clock-names.

I'd leave away the "pcie-" prefix since the surrounding context already
makes it clear that this is for PCIe.

It's redundant to have both a controller ID and parameterized register
offsets based on that controller ID. I would recommend keeping the
controller ID and then moving the register offsets to the driver and
decide based on the controller ID.

These seem more like configuration options rather than hardware

If we know these conditions, can we not determine that the fixup is

Wouldn't we want this to be the default? Why keep things powered up if

For power supplies we usually use the regulator bindings. Are there any
other cases where we'd need this?

It doesn't seem to me like claiming compatibility with "snps,dw-pcie" is
correct. There's a bunch of NVIDIA- or Tegra-specific properties below
and code in the driver. Would this device be able to function if no
driver was binding against the "nvidia,tegra194-pcie" compatible string?
Would it work if you left that out? I don't think so, so we should also
not list it here.

Why is there a reference to the BPMP in this propert?

aux-clk-freq and preset-init are not defined in the binding above.

These should be in decimal notation to make them easier to deal with. I

These are not defined in the binding above.

Might be better to split this into a separate patch.

Isn't the "phy-" implied by "p2u"? The name of the hardware block is
"Tegra194 P2U", so that "phy-" seems gratuitous to me.

"base" is a bad name. Each of these entries will be a "base" of the
given region. The name should specify what region it is the base of.
