The pci_ecam_ops.init function can be certainly reused but I agree
duplicating it is not a big deal either - I just noticed it and asked.

we can merge code as-is and think about writing a common init function
if/when needed.

I missed this one - thanks for clarifying.

DT PCI host bridge bootstrap is a different story and on that
consolidation is all but impossible.

I just want to keep MCFG ECAM quirks as simple as possible, code as it
stands is horrible enough and I wish I could remove the mechanism in
the future rather than adding more to it, hopefully we are getting
there.

That's fine, no problems with that.
