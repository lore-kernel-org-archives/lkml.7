Marc and I had a discussion about this and it looks like we may have an
issue here. So with the cancellation of logging, we do not trigger the
mmu_notifiers (as the userspace memory mapping hasn't changed) and thus
have memory leaks while trying to install a huge mapping. Would it be
possible for you to try the patch below ? It will trigger a WARNING
to confirm our theory, but should not cause the hang. As we unmap
the PMD/PUD range of PTE mappings before reinstalling a block map.

test: kvm: arm: Fix handling of stage2 huge mappings

We rely on the mmu_notifier call backs to handle the split/merging
of huge pages and thus we are guaranteed that while creating a
block mapping, the entire block is unmapped at stage2. However,
we miss a case where the block mapping is split for dirty logging
case and then could later be made block mapping, if we cancel the
dirty logging. This not only creates inconsistent TLB entries for
the pages in the the block, but also leakes the table pages for
PMD level.

Handle these corner cases for the huge mappings at stage2.
