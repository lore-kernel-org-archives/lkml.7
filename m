In the current encrypted tar file implementation, while the container
is running the decrypted tar file is extracted into the container root
and available for all to see.

The main security benefit of this implementation, as I said, is
security of at rest images and the runtime security is guaranteed by
other systems.

Are you asking about persistent volumes?  I can answer, but that's not
the current use case.  The current use case is encrypted images, which
are overlays.  If you mean the misconfigured backup comment then I was
thinking a backup that wrongly sweeps container root while the
container is running.

Lets go back to basics: can fscrypt provide equivalent or better
protection than the current encrypted tarfile approach?  If the answer
is no because it's too tightly tied to the android use case then
perhaps there's not much point discussing it further.
