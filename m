Hi Lorenzo/Srinath,

I look at the commit message again and indeed it looks quite confusing.

I'll add my comment inline in the code section. I hope that will help to
make it more clear.

I think the code comment above is much more clear than the commit
message. It looks like the commit message was to describe a particular
use case that prompts the code change. However, if I remember correctly,
during our internal review, I already made some modification to the code
to make the change much more generic than dealing with a special use
case. This patch contains the generic change I made.

Basically, 'size' is the intended outbound mapping size (from DT or ACPI
or whatever, it does not really matter). 'window_size' is a specific
mapping window size our PCIe controller can support. Our PCIe controller
supports a fixed set of outbound mapping window sizes. I don't think
this is much different from some other PCIe controllers.

It looks like, there are cases where one cannot find an exact match
between 'size' and 'window_size'. In this case, and when we know we have
already exhausted all possible mapping windows, i.e., 'size_idx' == 0
AND 'window_idx' == 0, we take a compromise by programming the outbound
mapping by using a window size that's actually larger than the 'size'.

Srinath, please correct me if I'm wrong. But I carefully reviewed the
code again and I believe this is essentially what it is.

If so, then the commit message is quite misleading and can be changed to
above descriptions.
