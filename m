It looks like having window1 and window2 is causing confusion here. I'll remove
them in my next patch.

Thanks for the pointer. I'll switch to this in the next patch.

You are right that maximum speed supported by hardware is fixed and through
max-link-speed DT option, flexibility is given to limit it to the desired speed
for a controller on a given platform. As mentioned in the documentation for max-link-speed,
this is a strategy to avoid unnecessary operation for unsupported link speed.
There is no real use-case as such even for setting the initial link speed, but it is
there to give flexibility (for any debugging) to get the link up at a certain speed
and then take it to a higher speed at a later point of time. Please note that, hardware
as such already has the capability to take the link to maximum speed agreed by both
upstream and downstream ports. 'nvidia,init-speed' is only to give more flexibility
while debugging. I'm OK to remove it if this is not adding much value here.

Since we have ASPM-L0s, L1, L1.1 and L1.2 states, I prefer to have just one entry
with different bit positions indicating which particular state should not be
advertised by root port. Do you see any particular advantage to have 4 different options?
If having one options is fine, I'll remove "nvidia," and document it in pci.txt.

We don't have any other use cases apart from regulator and muxes and I agree with
your comment that we should use regulator/mux frameworks than this generic GPIO
configuration. I'll make changes for this in the next patch series.
