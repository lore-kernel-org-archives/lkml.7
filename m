I see Marc applied this change in
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kvmarm/kvmarm.git/commit/?h=queue&id=e19b245fa4c61558536bd34f80845f0c41eab65f0

The risk here is that someone has a custom config from an old kernel
that explicitly turns CONFIG_ARM64_VHE off, and that try to use that
config with this patch.

I'm not sure how much we care about that.

Otherwise, blocking this config so that people don't accidentally rely
on it seems sensible.
