The problem is a bit more severe since, after printing "Querying
DEAD?" for CPU X, this CPU can prod another offline CPU Y on the same
core which, on waking up, will call rtas_stop_self. Thus we can have two
concurrent calls to rtas-stop-self, which is prohibited by the PAPR.

I haven't been able to observe the "Querying DEAD?" messages for the
online CPU which was being offlined and dlpar'ed out.

Based on the measurements that I did on a POWER9 system, in successful
cases of smp_query_cpu_stopped(cpu) returning affirmative, the maximum
time spent inside the loop was was 10ms.

Can we bumped up the tries to 100, so that we wait for 10ms before
printing the warning message ?
