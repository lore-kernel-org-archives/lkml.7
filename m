Taking into consideration the case where we could have several devices
attached to the same host iommu group, each of them possibly using
different host MSI doorbells, I think I am in trouble.

Let's assume that using the pcie-to-pci bridge trick on guest side they
end up in the same container and in the same guest iommu group.

At the moment there is a single MSI controller on guest, so the same
gIOVA/gDB S1 mapping is going to be created by the guest iommu dommain
and both devices are programmed with gIOVA. If dev0 and dev1 are
attached to different host MSI controllers, I would need to build the 2
nested bindings:
dev0: MSI nested binding: gIOVA -> gDB -> hDB0
dev1: MSI nested binding: gIOVA -> gDB -> hDB1
(on guest there is a single MSI controller at the moment)

which is not possible as the devices belong to the same host iommu group
and share the same mapping.

The solution would be to instantiate 2 MSI controllers on guest side, in
which case we would end up with
dev0: gIOVA0 -> gDB0 -> hDB0
dev1: gIOVA1 -> gDB1 -> hDB1

Isn't it somehow what we do with the IOMMU RID topology. We need to take
into account the host topology (2 devices belonging to the same group)
to force the same on guest by introducing a PCIe-to-PCI bridge. Here we
would need to say, those assigned devices are attached to different MSI
domains on host, so we need the same on guest.

Anyway, the current container based IOCTL would fail to implement that
because I would register gIOVA0 -> gDB0 and gIOVA1 -> gDB1 for each
device within the container which would definitively fail to build the
correct association. So I think I would need anyway a device based IOTCL
that would aim to tell: this assigned device uses this S1 MSI binding.
All the notification mechanism we have in qemu is based on container, so
this would obliged to have device based notification mechanism.

So I wonder whether it wouldn't be sensible to restrict this use case
and say we support nested mode only if we have a single assigned device
within the container?

Thoughts?
