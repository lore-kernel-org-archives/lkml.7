BTW, I would really appreciate somebody familiar with CIFS giving a braindump on
that.  Questions:

1) What's normally (== without malicious/broken server) seen when you mount
an IPC$ share?

2) Does it ever have subdirectories (i.e. can we fail a lookup in its root if it
looks like returning a subdirectory)?

3) If it can be non-empty, is there way to ask the server about its contents?
Short of "look every possible name up", that is...

As it is, the thing is abusing either cifs_lookup() (if it really shouldn't
have any files in it) or dcache_readdir().  Sure, dcache_readdir() can (and
should) pin a dentry while copying the name to userland, but WTF kind of
semantics it is?  "ls will return the things you'd guessed to look up, until
there's enough memory pressure to have them forgotten, which can happen at
any point with no activity on server"?
