Hi Jonathan and Nikolaus,

I would like to jump into this discussion a bit as well. Might be
slightly off topic or not... I'm not too familiar with the details of
IIO, but as Sony we do report accelerometer / gyroscope data through
/dev/input for our DualShock devices through hid-sony. This is among
reasons done for Android, which Nikolaus showed interest in as well.
We are working on exposing this data through user space through
standard Android APIs (see,
https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/hardware/libhardware/+/5=
71762/).
The work will likely be merged later this year and it is already used
in some devices. Main reason it wasn't merged yet it that in our case
we have multiple evdev devices (gamepad, touchpad, motion sensors) and
need to tie those together for applications. Android doesn't support a
good mechanism for that yet.

Since the IIO input work relates to our Android work as well, I will
jump in more from the sidelines to make sure things are done in a
consistent manner. The main concern are resolution and value ranges.

Thanks,
Roderick

m/s^2 is conceptually right, but others have been using 'g' for input,
so I would consider that the standard now. Also leaves handling of
location on Earth to user space instead of assuming a fixed conversion
to 9.81 m/s^2.

We at the time were one of the first to expose acceleration and gyro
data through /dev/input for DualShock 4 as supported by hid-sony. We
report acceleration in 'g' and angular velocity in 'degree / s'. We
set the resolution to respectively '1 g' and '1 degree / s'. The range
we set to the range of the device e.g. for DS4 -4g to +4g for
acceleration. I need to check though what coordinate system we use,
but I think it is right handed (gyro counter clockwise relative to
acceleration axes).

The two other drivers using INPUT_PROC_ACCELEROMETER are hid-wacom and
hid-udraw-ps3 Wacom. Both seem to report resolution in 'g'  as well.
