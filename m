I absolutely agree. A hypothetical benefit of a new implementation
doesn't outweigh the complexity the existing code has to jump over or
worse is not aware of and it is broken silently. My general experience
is that the later is more likely with a large variety of drivers we have
in the tree and odd things they do in general.
