Hi,

So bascally the same results as with the edge-triggered interrupt patch/hack,
right?

Are you still using the edge-triggered interrupt patch, or just the new
patch Kai-Heng Feng provided.

To me it sounds like the patch Kai-Heng Feng provided at least removes
the need for the edge-triggered interrupt patch/hack and what remains to
be solved is the suspend/resume issues.

Regards,

Hans
