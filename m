Fair enough. Al also pointed out on IRC that the __getname/__putname
caches are likely to be hot, so using that may be less costly cpu-wise.

This I'm not sure of. commit 79b33c8874334e (ceph: snapshot nfs re-
export) explains this a bit, but I'm not sure it really covers this
case.

Zheng/Sage, feel free to correct me here:

My understanding is that for snapshots you need the base inode number,
snapid, and the full path from there to the dentry for a ceph MDS call.

There is a filehandle type for a snapshotted inode:

struct ceph_nfs_snapfh {
        u64 ino;
        u64 snapid;
        u64 parent_ino;
        u32 hash;
} __attribute__ ((packed));

So I guess it is possible. You could do name_to_handle_at for an inode
deep down in a snapshotted tree, and then try to open_by_handle_at after
the dcache gets cleaned out for some other reason.

What I'm not clear on is why we need to build paths at all for
snapshots. Why is a parent inode number (inside the snapshot) + a snapid
+ dentry name not sufficient?

We could stick that in ceph_dentry_info (->d_fsdata). We have a flags
field in there already.
