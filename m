I've also not seen patches to fix all the places where 'lock bit' operations
get used on int [] data.
Testing had showed one structure that needed 'fixing', there are some others
that are in .bss/.data.
A kernel build could suddenly have them misaligned and crossing a cache line.

All the places that cast the pointer to the bit ops are suspect.
