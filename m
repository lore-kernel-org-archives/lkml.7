What does that have to do with this patch?  The only thing this patch does
is clear a *software* bit that says "SGX LC is enabled" so that the kernel
can make the reasonable assumption that the MSRs are writable when
X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC=1.

Again, that's a micro-architecture detail due to the use of range registers
to carve out the EPC.  The only thing the SDM states regarding size and
alignment is:

  The EPC is divided into EPC pages. An EPC page is 4KB in size and always
  aligned on a 4KB boundary.

Unfortunate, yes, but it does not violate the architecture in any way.
You can argue that it adds a wrinkle that isn't explicitly documented
in the SDM, but virtualization is full of things like that.

Half dozen of one, six of the other.  If we clear the flag, then KVM has
to manually probe the MSRs.  If we don't clear the flag, then the driver
has to manually probe the MSRs.

Alternatively we could add another flag, but then we end up with
X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC and X86_FEATURE_SGX_LE_PUBKEY_HASH_WRITABLE, or maybe
X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC_REALLY_TRULY_ENABLED.

Exactly.  KVM will probe the MSRs once during its own loading.
