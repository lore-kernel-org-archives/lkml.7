As I wrote above, I did not question the internal review process at all,
we do internal review at ARM too in preparation for posting publicly but
I think the patches review should take place on public mailing lists and
tags should be given accordingly, that's it.

You may see it as churn, fair enough, it is not a big deal either.

There is nothing next :) - I just would like to see patches discussions
and reviews taking place on linux-pci@vger.kernel.org for PCI patches,
I do not think I am asking too much.

Thanks,
