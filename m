Yeah, I was looking for a better solution and eventually decided to just
copy what was done in the past.

That sounds like a good idea that I didn't think of. If I can't find
something better, I'll do that.

There are lots of copies of cmdline around, but none that are available
for early param. I did a sampling of some of the other early params but
none seem to be anywhere near as complex as the PCI one and I haven't
yet found one that needs to keep a copy of any or all of the command line.

In any case, I'll keep digging and try to get a better patch for you
shortly.
