Thanks for your prompt reply and thoughts on our patch.

Let us briefly describe our test setup to ensure everyone on this mailing
list is one the same page.

Our general setup looks like this:
1 $ iw wlp1s0 info
Interface wlp1s0
      ifindex 5
      wdev 0x1
      addr 4c:5e:0c:11:43:ac
      type managed
      wiphy 0
      txpower 30.00 dBm
1 $ iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor
1 $ iw phy phy0 interface add mon1 type monitor

When we send (raw) packets on mon0 using packetspammer [1] and listen on
the _other_ monitor mode interface mon1, we receive frames that were sent
on the first one:
1 $ packetspammer mon0
2 $ tcpdump -i mon1 'wlan addr2 13:22:33:44:55:66'

This is due to the fact that frames sent on mon0 are echoed back as TX
status frames, because REQ_TX_STATUS is always set for frames sent from
monitor mode interfaces.

But when we replace mon0 with an interface in managed mode (wlp1s0), the
receipt of frames stops, because in managed mode REQ_TX_STATUS is cleared
in most frames:
1 $ ifup wlp1s0
1 $ ping -I wlp1s0 192.168.254.1 # this address is not assigned to any host
2 $ tcpdump -i mon1 ‚wlan addr2 4c:5e:0c:11:43:ac‘

What we propose is to use IFF_ECHO to force REQ_TX_STATUS being set for all
frames sent on the interface. But you are right: The goal is that frames
transmitted through the other interface show up on the monitor interface
(but only after passing the driver). However, this is exactly how we
understand the semantics of IFF_ECHO in the kernel documentation.

As far as we know, drivers must return a TX status frame, if REQ_TX_STATUS
is set, but can do whatever they want, if it is clear. This is no problem for our
functionality, because we force the delivery of TX status frames by
permanently setting REQ_TX_STATUS. As long as the semantics of
REQ_TX_STATUS remains like it is now, the functionality will always be
as expected from our API.

We could also achieve the functionality by modifying the drivers but this
would mean that we had to add this functionality to every driver.
Moreover, the feature of TX status frames, how it is implemented currently
for monitor mode interfaces, is part of the mac80211 implementation. The
decision to force TX status frames for monitor mode interfaces is made in
the common mac80211 implementation.
