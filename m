Ah, thanks for clarifying. I don't think that's a problem in our case.
If the guest provides an incorrect address, the hardware simply won't
allow the host to access it.

Yes.

Well, I guess that would be the third half of the issue. :-)

Yes, I will have a look. As you mentioned already, virtio-iommu doesn't
define a way to request iommu bypass for a device so that would have to
be added.

Though to be honest in practice I don't think such a feature in
virtio-iommu would make things easier for us, at least in the short
term. It would take the same effort to define a powerpc-specific
hypercall to accomplish the same thing (easier, in fact since we
wouldn't have to implement the rest of virtio-iommu). In fact, there
already is such hypercall, but it is only defined for VIO devices
(RTAS_IBM_SET_TCE_BYPASS in QEMU). We would have to make it work on
virtio devices as well.
