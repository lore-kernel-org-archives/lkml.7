OK, I'm not opposed to keeping the ABI as-is, with the above
clarification [*] spelled out appropriately for both cases.

Alternatively, or in addition, we could say something like:

"If KVM_CAP_ARM_PTRAUTH_ADDRESS and KVM_CAP_ARM_PTRAUTH_GENERIC are
both present, then both KVM_ARM_VCPU_PTRAUTH_ADDRESS and
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PTRAUTH_GENERIC must be requested or neither must be
requested."
