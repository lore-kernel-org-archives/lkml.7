A nice-to-have:
Because you only use the 'LO' asm-offset definitions here, we have to just assume that the
'HI' ones are adjacent. Is it possible to add a BUILD_BUG() somewhere (probably in
asm-offsets.c) to check this? As its just an enum we'd expect the order to be arbitrary,
and asm-offsets to take care of any re-ordering... (struct randomisation may one day come
to enums!)

Can you check my reasoning here, to make sure I've understood this properly?!:

This clears the API/APK bits to enable the traps, if the system supports ptrauth, and if
Qemu requested it for this vcpu. If any of those things aren't true, the guest gets
HCR_GUEST_FLAGS, which also has the API/APK bits clear...

What this is doing is clearing the API/APK bits that may have been left set by a previous
run of a ptrauth-enabled vcpu.

Could this hunk go in the previous patch that added the vcpu definitions?
It would be good if the uapi defines, the documentation and this validation logic came as
one patch, it makes future archaeology easier!


Looks good!

Thanks,

James
