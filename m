We began by focusing on certificates for keys that can be added at
runtime.  Before adding support for revocation, we plan to gather
additional use cases.  In the meantime, unwanted certificates can be
removed by the administrator.

The API is still a work in progress.  We are planning to publish a document
describing the current API and overall design shortly.

Perhaps the biggest departure is that the secure variables are stored in
flash memory that is not lockable.  In order to protect the secure
variables, hashes of the flash regions where they're stored are written to
TPM NVRAM indices.  The TPM NVRAM indices we use are write locked at
runtime.  The sysadmin enqueues update commands in flash.  During the next
boot, the firmware verifies and processes the commands to update the
certificate store and accompanying integrity hashes in the TPM NVRAM
indices and write locks them.  Before certificates read from flash are
used, the certificate store is hashed and compared against the hashes
stored from the TPM.  The one exception is the PK. We store it in a TPM
NVRAM index by itself rather than flash because updates to it must be
guaranteed to be atomic.

In our use case,  the three-level key hierarchy conveniently supports the
concept of (1) an administrator authority, who authorizes (2) other
organizations, e.g., distros, to provide (3) certificates for their code
signing keys.   By using efivars, we leverage pre-existing userspace EFI
tools to generate authenticated updates and certificates.  Additionally,
pre-existing kernel infrastructure simplifies efivars processing.
