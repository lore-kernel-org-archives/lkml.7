AFAIU, Spec doesn't say anything about whether PME interrupt should be through MSI
or by other means. As far as Tegra194 is concerned, there are only two
interrupt lanes that go from PCIe IP to GIC, one being legacy interrupt (that
represents legacy interrupts coming over PCIe bus from downstream devices and
also the events happening internal to root port) and the other being MSI
interrupt (that represents MSI interrupts coming over PCIe bus from downstream
devices). Since hardware folks had a choice to route PME interrupts either
through legacy interrupt line or through MSI interrupt line and legacy interrupt
line was chosen as a design choice. That being the case at hardware level, I tried
to inform the same through pcie_pme_disable_msi() to PCIe sub-system that
PME interrupts are not expected over MSI.

Is it OK to save pci_host_bridge pointer in pcie_port structure directly? I see
that as another way to get pci_host_bridge pointer from pcie_port
structure. My understanding is that, to get pci_host_bridge pointer, either
pcie_port structure should be part of pci_host_bridge structure (which is the
case with all non-DW implementations) or pcie_port should have a pointer to
some structure which is directly (and not by means of a pointer) part of
pci_host_bridge structure so that container_of() can be used to get pci_host_bridge.
As I see, there is no data object of pci_host_bridge whose pointer is saved in
pcie_port structure. In fact, in reverse, pcie_port's struct dev pointer is saved
as parent to pci_host_bridge's struct dev. So, another way would be to iterate over
the children of pcie_port's struct dev pointer to find pci_host_bridge's dev pointer
and from there get pci_host_bridge through container_of. But, I think is complicating
it more than using bus pointer from pcie_port. I'm not sure if I'm able to convey the
issue I'm facing here to get pci_host_bridge from pcie_port, but doing any other thing seems complicating it even more.

.remove() internally calls pm_runtime_put_sync() API which calls
.runtime_suspend(). I made a new patch to add a host_deinit() call
which make all these calls. Since host_init() is called from inside
.runtime_resume() of this driver, to be in sync, I'm now calling
host_deinit() from inside .runtime_suspend() API.
