I believe you can do the limit outside easily, such as by checking
how many pages have been added to the bio.

Previously this bio is allowed to add at most 'nblocks' pages, however,
now we are allowed to add at most 'nblocks' io vecs, instead of pages.

I don't understand why, could you explain a bit why erofs reads more?

The amount depends on how many pages you added to the bio.

As I mentioned, you may count how many pages added to bio, or you still
can get the number via bio_segments(bio).

Thanks,
