I would leave this last sentence out, because:
1. It is an implementation detail that doesn't impact this user ABI.
2. It is not entirely accurate: untagging the pointer may be needed for various kinds 
of address lookup (like finding the corresponding VMA), at which point the kernel 
usually already knows it is a userspace pointer.

I don't think that's very clear, this doesn't say how the mapping is obtained. Maybe 
"a mapping obtained by the process using brk() or sbrk()"?

With the rules above, the code section is included as well. Replacing "i.e." with 
"e.g." would avoid having to list every single section (which is probably not a good 
idea anyway).
