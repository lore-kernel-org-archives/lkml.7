I=E2=80=99m going to put my vDSO maintainer hat on for a minute.  Cedric, y=
our
proposal has the following issues related specifically to the vDSO:

It inherently contains indirect branches.  This means that, on
retpoline configurations, it probably needs to use retpolines.  This
is doable, but it=E2=80=99s nasty, and you need to worry about register
clobbers.

It uses effectively unbounded stack space. The vDSO timing functions
are already a problem for Go, and this is worse.

And with my vDSO hat back off, I find it disappointing that SGX SDKs
seem willing to couple the SGX enclaves so tightly to their host ABIs.
An *unmodified* SGX enclave should be able to run, without excessive
annoyance, in a Windows process, a Linux process, a C process, a Java
process, a Go process, and pretty much any other process.  Saying
=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=99ll just recompile it=E2=80=9D is a bad solution =E2=80=
=94 for enclaves that use
MRENCLAVE, you can=E2=80=99t, and for enclaves that use MRSIGNER, you need =
to
deal with the fact the protecting the signing key is a big deal.
Someone should be able to port the entire host program to a different
language without losing secrets and without access to a signing key.

Cedric, your proposal allows an enclave to muck with RSP, but not in a
way that=E2=80=99s particularly pleasant.  Since the ISA is set in stone, w=
e
can=E2=80=99t do anything about the enclave=E2=80=99s access to its caller=
=E2=80=99s
registers.  I would love to see a straightforward way to run an
enclave such that it does not access the main untrusted stack at all =E2=80=
=94
uRSP and uRBP should be arbitrary values passed in the untrusted code,
and the values the enclave sets should be relayed back to the caller
but otherwise not have any effect.  Sadly I see no way to do this
short of using GSBASE to store the real untrusted stack pointer.
Other than the segment bases, there appear to be literally zero
untrusted registers that are reliably preserved across an enclave
entry and exit.  I suppose we should use a syscall to help.

Since the above tricks seem unlikely to make it into the kernel, I
think we=E2=80=99re doing everyone a favor if the Linux APIs strongly
encourage SDK authors to build enclaves in a way that they don=E2=80=99t ma=
ke
problematic assumptions about the untrusted world. I would really like
to see enclaves generated by the Linux SDK work on Windows and vice
versa.
