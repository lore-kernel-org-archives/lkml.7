Yes whatever is more appropriate for eahc end_io func.

It depends, some get page to page-cache (find_get_page), other just
get_page on a page that is coming from unknown origin (ie it is not
clear from within the function where the page is coming from), other
allocate a page and transfer the page reference to the bio ie the
page will get free once the bio end function is call through as it
call call put_page on page within the bio.

So there is not one simple story here. Hence why it looks harder to
me (still likely do-able).

No i do not know of any such example but reading through a lot of code
i could not convince myself of that fact. I agree with your feeling on
the matter i just don't have proof. I can spend more time digging all
code path and ascertaining thing but this will inevitably be a snapshot
in time and something that people might break in the future.

Yes we do plan on catching things like underflow (easy one to catch)
or put_page that bring the refcount just below the bias value ... and
in anycase the only harm that can come of this should be memory leak.

So i believe that even if we miss some weird corner case we should be
able to catch it eventualy and nothing harmful should ever happen,
famous last word i will regret when i get burnt at the stake for missing
that one case ;)

Will try to get started on that and see if i hit any roadblock. I will
report once i get my feet wet, or at least before i drown ;)
