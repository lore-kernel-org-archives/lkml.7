The ttyAMA drivers do not have support for atomic printing, so it is not
the new atomic feature that is causing the mangling. For your setup, all
printk console printing is being handled within a specific context, the
printk kernel thread.

It looks to me like some userspace application (systemd?) is writing
directly to /dev/ttyAMA0. If the kernel is also writing to this device
(because it is setup as a console), then the output will be
mangled. There is no high-level synchronization between console output
and directly writing to UART devices. Maybe you need to set your
loglevel so that the kernel does not do the printing? For example,
loglevel=1?

You should see this problem with older kernel versions as well.

dmesg just dumps the kernel log buffer. The log buffer is synchronized
(even for atomic writes), so it will never show the mangling.
