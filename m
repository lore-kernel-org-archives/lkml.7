Only while the filesystem is mounted. So you would do something like:

 - Mount filesystem
 - Build and load
 - Unmount

The 30MB would only be used while the filesystem is mounted.

Compared to:
 - Extract tarball
 - Build and load
 - Remove file tree from filesystem

There are lots of things where we provide suitable ways of doing
things to the user instead of making them come up with their own
handling of things. devtmpfs is a perfect example of this -- doing
things in userspace was perfectly possible but still a hassle in many
cases, and having the kernel do it for you when it already has the
data makes sense.

I'd expect many users to still want to do this to tmpfs. Also, I
expect whatever userspace tools and programs that will consume this
data is likely to consume similar or more memory while running anyway.
So mounting + copying + unmounting on the heavily constrained systems
shouldn't be raising the high water mark on memory consumption.

The argument that this needs to go into /proc because Android is
removing debugfs isn't a very strong one.

And "debugfs breakages aren't bugs" is exactly why I'm suggesting to
do the non-supported export of the archive that way instead.

That wasn't captured with the patch submission, and having people go
find 100s of emails to figure out why your seemingly lacking solution
is the best one available is not how you motivate getting your code
into the kernel.

That should be documented.

I've found support for the desire to provide headers. If there's so
much support for this solution, the number of Acks to the patch should
have been higher.

Really?

Nah, this is a minor detail.

Only while mounted.

See comments above about high water marks for memory consumption
likely not moving much.

Not my problem.

It adds a new dependency on tar.

Sure.

Sure.

What requirements?
