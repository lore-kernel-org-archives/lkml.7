Luckily the defaults have already been chosen.  So "reasonable" just
means to use the defaults.

Sure, it's a bit long.  But it's also easier to remember and more
self-documenting than any shortened option I could come up with.

In your scenario, the fact that it's so easy to remember would save the
day, since you wouldn't have to go look up some obscure shortened option
name in the documentation :-)

Suggestions are welcome but I couldn't come up with a reasonable shorter
option.

I agree with those people.  In my world "mtg" is short for meeting.

No, because

a) We aren't enabling/disabling *vulnerabilities*, but rather
   mitigations;

b) We aren't enabling/disabling *all* CPU mitigations, only the
   speculative ones.

Except that it's not called "cpu_vulns"...
