KT, do you know anything about using edge interrupts with your hid-over-i2c products?

Ya, I sent the patch to Vladislav for testing his 5 finger-tap issue.

The patch is created by Dell/Intel for debugging Elan PTP's incomplete report message.
Host tried to get report again while touchpad finish report transmission.

I excerpt from Dell's mail
===========Begin=========================
We have worked with Intel for a while to revise Linux kernel driver code to prevent Touch I2C error message show up,
And Intel dig out there’re 2 issues to cause this i2c error on Linux kernel 4.18.

Therefore Intel suggested to revised SW code into “trigger falling edge + pm_disabled + IRQF_SHARED | IRQF_COND_SUSPEND(i2c-designware-master.c)” 
and then we can get positive result that i2c error message disappeared when Touch Panel is working.

Since this issue only happened on ELAN touch pad + Intel GLK platform (Linux) and other Intel reference platform (Whisky lake) won’t, would you help check the solution (as patch attached)  and let us know if any question/concern for this modification?  
===========End=========================

I don't know the root cause of 5-finger issue with level trigger so far.
I will check it once I get the touchpad with the same issue.

From previous issue list, it seems that some touchpad's crush issue will be fixed by edge trigger.

I have discussed with FW engineer, both level and edge trigger should be OK for our PTP(HID touchpad).
I summary the behavior of our HID touchpad's interrupt.
1. Assert for Every finger's report, which means 5 ISR for 5 finger operation.
2. We will de-assert INT pin after the last byte's NACK signal.
   I checked LA scope, 2nd finger's assert will happen after 10us if two finger touch.
   SYNAPTICS's touchpad will de-assert it after address byte sent. 
	 
I am not sure if SYNAPTICE's earlier de-asserting is a better way for level-trigger?
At least we never see issue happen on our PTP in Windows 10.

That is because MS spec for HID over I2C requires level interrupts:

"7.4 Interrupt Line Management

DEVICE is responsible to assert the interrupt line (level trigger interrupt required) when it has data.

DEVICE must keep the interrupt line asserted until the data has been fully read by the HOST. After this point, the DEVICE must de-assert the interrupt line if it has no more data to report to the HOST.
When the DEVICE has new data to report, it must repeat the process above."

See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/hardware/design/dn642101(v=vs.85)

This behavior would violate HID-over-I2C spec though.
