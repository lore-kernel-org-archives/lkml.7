(cc'ing linux-cifs)

I don't see a problem doing what you suggest. An offset + fixed length
buffer would be fine there.

Is there a real benefit to using __getname though? It sucks when we have
to reallocate but I doubt that it happens with any frequency. Most of
these paths will end up being much shorter than PATH_MAX and that slims
down the memory footprint a bit.

Also, FWIW -- this code was originally copied from cifs'
build_path_from_dentry(). Should we aim to put something in common
infrastructure that both can call?

There are some significant logic differences in the two functions though
so we might need some sort of callback function or something to know
when to stop walking.
