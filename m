Hi all,
I'll send a single v2 patch in some minutes.

Changes compared to this v1:
* add linux-input list and maintainers for discussion
* use input-polldev
* allocate one mapping record for each iio device instead of trying to =
manage that in some array

Because this is a quite fundamental design decision (do we call =
input_register_device
or input_register_polled_device?) and the above expressed concern about =
noise
triggering more input events than user-space may want to see, I have =
stayed
with low-speed polling for the time being.

I finally found it. It is an input-polldev wrapper.

I have reworked the driver in polling mode to use that now. It has =
simplified the
code a lot.

Thanks again!
