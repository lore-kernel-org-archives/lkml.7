Oh, now I see. And yes you are correct.

I wonder if we should not consider the mouse in hid-logitech-dj then.
And let hid-logitech-dj merge the 2 nodes together into one hidpp
device, and so we are facing a "regular" HID++ device which is
consistent.

Unfortunately, I am not sure I'll have the time to work on it this week :/

Cheers,
Benjamin
