It's really not, the exact same technique could be used on any type of
command to imply ordering. My initial idea was to have an explicit
barrier/ordering command, but I didn't think that separating it from an
actual command would be needed/useful.

FUA would be a WRITEV/WRITE_FIXED flag, that should be trivially doable.

In terms of cache flush, that's very heavy handed (and storage
oriented).  What applications would want/need to do an explicit whole
device flush?
