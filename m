What do you mean ?

> But we never decrement that bkt_clamp value on dequeue.

We decrement the bkt_clamp value only when the bucket becomes empty
and thus we pass the condition above. That's what the comment above is
there to call out.

Never, given the current code, that's just defensive programming.

If in the future the accounting should be accidentally broken by some
refactoring we warn and fix the corrupted data structures at first
chance.

Is that so bad?

That's related to the comment above, when you say we don't decrement
the bkt_clamp.

Because of backetization, we potentially end up tracking tasks with
different requested clamp values in the same bucket.

For example, with 20% bucket size, we can have:
  Task1: util_min=25%
  Task2: util_min=35%
accounted in the same bucket.

This ensure that while they are both running we boost 35%. If Task1
should run longer than Task2, Task1 will be "overboosted" until its
end. The bucket value will be reset to 20% (nominal value) when both
tasks are idle.

Yes, at this point we know there are no more tasks in this bucket and
we reset its value.

Nothing... but that's an expected consequence of bucketization.

> Why are we doing this... ?

You can either decide to:

 a) always boost tasks to just the bucket nominal value
    thus always penalizing both Task1 and Task2 of the example above

 b) always boost tasks to the bucket "max" value
    thus always overboosting both Task1 and Task2 of the example above

The solution above instead has a very good property: in systems
where you have only few and well defined clamp values we always
provide the exact boost.

For example, if your system requires only 23% and 47% boost values
(totally random numbers), then you can always get the exact boost
required using just 3 bucksts or ~33% size each.

In systems where you don't know which boost values you will have, you
can still defined the maximum overboost granularity you accept for
each task by just tuning the number of clamp groups. For example, with
20 groups you can have a 5% max overboost.
