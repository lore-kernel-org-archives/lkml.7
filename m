They are also other code that pass around bio_vec and the code that
fill it is disconnected from the code that release the page and they
can mix and match GUP and non GUP AFAICT.

On fs side they are also code that fill either bio or bio_vec and
use some extra mechanism other than bio_end to submit io through
workqueue and then release pages (cifs for instance). Again i believe
they can mix and match GUP and non GUP (i have not spotted something
obvious indicating otherwise).

Yes this patchset already convert some of this first pattern.

I believe direct-io.c is such example thought in that case i believe it
can only be the ZERO_PAGE so this might easily detectable. They are also
lot of fs functions taking an iterator and then using iov_iter_get_pages*()
to fill a bio. AFAICT those functions can be call with pipe iterator or
iovec iterator and probably also with other iterator type. But it is all
common code afterward (the bi_end_io function is the same no matter the
iterator).

Thought that can probably be solve that way:

From:
    foo_bi_end_io(struct bio *bio) {
        ...
        for (i = 0; i < npages; ++i) {
            put_page(pages[i]);
        }
    }

To:
    foo_bi_end_io_common(struct bio *bio) {
        ...
    }

    foo_bi_end_io_normal(struct bio *bio)
        foo_bi_end_io_common(bio);
        for (i = 0; i < npages; ++i) {
            put_page(pages[i]);
        }
    }

    foo_bi_end_io_gup(struct bio *bio)
        foo_bi_end_io_common(bio);
        for (i = 0; i < npages; ++i) {
            put_user_page(pages[i]);
        }
    }

Then when filling in the bio i either pick foo_bi_end_io_normal() or
foo_bi_end_io_gup(). I am assuming that bio with different bi_end_io
function never get merge.

The issue is that some bio_add_page*() call site are disconnected
from where the bio is allocated and initialized (and also where the
bi_end_io function is set). This make it quite hard to ascertain
that GUPed page and non GUP page can not co-exist in same bio.

Also in some cases it is not clear that the same iter is use to
fill the same bio ie it might be possible that some code path fill
the same bio from different iterator (and thus some pages might
be coming from GUP and other not).

It would certainly seems to require more careful review from the
maintainers of such fs. I tend to believe that putting the burden
on the reviewer is a harder sell :)

From quick glance:
   - nilfs segment thing
   - direct-io same bio accumulate pages over multiple call but
     it should always be from same iterator and thus either always
     be from GUP or non GUP. Also the ZERO_PAGE case should be easy
     to catch.
   - fs/nfs/blocklayout/blocklayout.c
   - gfs2 log buffer, that should never be page from GUP but i could
     not ascertain that easily from quick review

This is not extensive, i was just grepping for bio_add_page() and
they are 2 other variant to check and i tended to discard places
where bio is allocated in same function as bio_add_page() but this
might not be a valid assumption either. Some bio might be allocated
and only if there is no default bio already and then set as default
bio which might be use latter on with different iterator.

No, i thought about it seemed more dangerous and harder to get right
because some code add page in one place and setup bio in another. I
can dig some more on that front but this still leave the non-bio user
of bio_vec and those IIRC also suffer from same disconnect issue.

Yeah and that patchset should address those already, i do not think
i missed any.
