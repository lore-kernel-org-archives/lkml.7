Hi, Mike

forking thread fails to create the process ,and then free the allocated task struct.
Other userfaultfd monitor thread should not access the stale mm->owner.

The parent process and child process do not share the mm struct.  Userfaultfd monitor thread's
mm->owner should not point to the freed child task_struct.

and due to the existence of tasklist_lock,  we can not specify the mm->owner to freed task_struct.

I miss something,=-O
