I mean use in languages and runtimes that allow a function and its
callees to pause and then resume later.  Something like (pseudocode,
obviously):

void invoke_the_enclave()
{
  do_eenter_through_vdso();
}

void some_ocall_handler(void *ptr)
{
  yield;
}

If the enclave has ptr pointing to the untrusted stack, then this gets
quite awkward for the runtime to handle efficiently.  IMO a much nicer
approach would be:

void invoke_the_enclave()
{
  char buffer[1024];
  while (true)
  {
    eenter (through vdso);
    if (exit was an ocall request) {
      some_ocall_handler(buffer);
    }
  }
}

And now there is nothing funny happening behind the runtime's back
when some_ocall_handler tries to yield.
