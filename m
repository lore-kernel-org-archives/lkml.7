Ok, how about the diff below on top of:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/arm64/linux.git/log/?h=for-next/mmiowb

?

I do plan to investigate ioremap_wc() and friends in the future, but it's
been painful enough just dealing with the common case! I'll almost certainly
need your help with that too.
