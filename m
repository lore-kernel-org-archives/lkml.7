There are two bits of MSR TEST_CTL defined in Intel SDM now, which is bit 29 and
bit 31. Bit 31 is not used in kernel, and here we only need to switch bit 29
between host and guest. 
So should I also change the name to atomic_switch_split_lock_detect() to
indicate that we only switch bit 29?

Indeed, if we use split lock detection for protection purpose, when host has it
enabled we should directly pass it to guest and forbid guest from disabling it.
And only when host disables split lock detection, we can expose it and allow the
guest to turn it on.

If it is used for protection purpose, then it should follow what you said and
this feature needs to be disabled by default. Because there are split lock
issues in old/current kernels and BIOS. That will cause the existing guest
booting failure and killed due to those split lock.

If it is only used for debug purpose, I think it might be OK to enable this
feature by default and make it indepedent between host and guest?

So I think how to handle this feature between host and guest depends on how we
use it? Once you give me a decision, I will follow it in next version.
