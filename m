Both please. Neither adds much.

That ended up in the wrong place...
It was the in_hid_probe just after here that I was referring to.

I'm not totally sure I can see why.  You can go from backwards and forwards
from any of the pointers...

No, just dev_warn(dev,....)

It's the same one I think at this particular location.
