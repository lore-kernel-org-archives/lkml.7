I think performance is a red herring, especially since you have to
uncompress it on every compiler invocation. With this you'd need to
read/touch/write _all_ header files, not just the one your current
compiler invocation will use.

In the grand scheme of things, open/mmap syscalls wouldn't necessarily
be slower.

This is now a circular argument. Joel was stating that the plain text
headers took up too much memory, but now it's preferred to create such
filesystem in userspace memory on *every compiler invocation*?
That's... not better. And definitely worse if you want to compile in
parallel.


From my perspective, this is where we're at:

This patch seems to have been met with a lot of responses in the tone
of "this is not an appealing solution". Meanwhile, some of the
suggested alternative solutions have not worked out, and we are now at
a point where there's less interest in exploring alternatives and
arguments to merge as-is with only minor adjustments.

I understand the desire to solve this. It'd be really convenient to
have a way to runtime build against the same structure layouts that
the kernel was built with. But I haven't heard anyone say that they
*like* the solution proposed, and I haven't seen many of those
expressing concerns being converted to support it.

Usually what we do at times like this is that we say "Yeah, this is a
problem that should be solved, but this solution doesn't seem to be
the right one and we would need to maintain it forever as part of the
ABI. Let's wait until a better solution is found." With time,
sometimes a better solution becomes obvious, or circumstances change
enough to allow for some different approach, or someone has a new idea
from a different perspective that solves the same problem.

All of that being said, I don't have veto rights on code going into
the kernel, even if I think picking up this patch would be the wrong
thing to do.

I'd be a *lot* less hesitant if this went into debugfs or another
location than /proc, which is one of the most regression-sensitive
interfaces we have in the kernel.
