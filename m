It is a performance drop that can be avoided, so it might as well be.
Splitting the success path from the failure path is common for I/O drivers
for similar reasons as here: the success path can be optimized whereas the
failure path potentially needs to sleep.

As it is written, synchronization is needed to stop the same mrq being
finished twice.

I suggest doing the dmaengine_terminate_sync() before calling
sdhci_request_done().  Perhaps you could record the channel that needs to be
sync'd and then do:

	struct dma_chan *chan = READ_ONCE(host->sync_chan);

	if (chan) {
		dmaengine_terminate_sync(chan);
		host->sync_chan = NULL;
	}
