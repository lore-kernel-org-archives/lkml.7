Because Tegra194 doesn't support raising PME interrupts through MSI line.

This is a guideline from the hardware team that MSI for PME should be disabled.
I'll make an explicit comment in the code that it is specific to Tegra194.

.runtime_resume() not only gets called during resume, but also in normal path
as we are using PM framework and pm_runtime_get_sync() gets called finally
in the probe which executes .runtime_resume() hook.

As per Thierry Reding's suggestion, I'll be using a goto statement to avoid
recursion and that should simplify things here.

I think so.

I'll add a comment explicitly to state the same.

I gave my reasoning as to why with the current code, it is not possible to get the
pci_host_bridge structure pointer from struct pcie_port pointer in another thread as
a reply to Thierry Reding's comments. Since Jishen'g changes to support remove functionality
are accepted, I think using bus pointer saved in struct pcie_port pointer shouldn't be
any issue now. Please do let me know if that is something not acceptable.

When other Designware implementations add remove functionality, even they should
be calling these APIs (Jisheng also mentioned the same in his commit message)
