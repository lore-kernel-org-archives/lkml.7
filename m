I'd prefer to move the old, crufty, obsolete and generally
unsupported drivers to new directory trees and possibly
symlink those drivers to their current locations.

I suggested on the kernel summit list:
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/ksummit-discuss/2019-June/006482.html

Perhaps a mechanism to move these old, generally unsupported
by an actual maintainer, and rarely tested drivers out of the
mainline drivers directory into a separate obsolete directory
would help isolate the whitespace and trivial api changes.
