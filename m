No. Just because we ony use the split lock bit now, there is no
jusification to name everything splitlock. This is going to have renamed
when yet another bit is added in the future. The MSR is exposed to the
guest and the restriction of bits happens to be splitlock today.

Rightfully so.

No. It does not make sense.

As I said: The host kernel makes the decision.

If the host kernel has it enabled then the guest is not allowed to change
it. If the guest triggers an #AC it will be killed.

If the host kernel has it disabled then the guest can enable it for it's
own purposes.
