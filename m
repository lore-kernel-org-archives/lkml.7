I think Mika's point was not that you should avoid changing the
comment, but that your new comment could be rewrapped so it used the
whole 80 column width, which matches the rest of the file.  That's
trivial to do and if you don't do it I can do it while applying the
patch.

I usually don't request changes in the order, so it doesn't really
matter to me, but I personally put the declarations in the order of
their use in the code below.

I assume you'll do that for mmio.start and mmio_pref.start as well?
