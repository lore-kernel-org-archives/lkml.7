I think that keeping the more verbose comments is better. You directly see
what operations are needed, and is a good reminder, especially if you
are not familiar with the driver.
I'll use your comment on the next version if you insist (see below for
why new versoion).

It might provide some power-saving, so I would keep that function.

Indeed the previous values at start do not matter. It's there just to
shut down the device properly.
This discussion made me verify again the specs and in its current form
the disable doesn't even work at all :
 - That register should be written with write protection disabled (duh!)
 - It doesn't even stop the FTM from running, the clock must be
disabled for that.

So I'll probably provide a fix for that (in some days/weeks).

yes it provides more features, those are in a backlog ;). I would
prefer if this simple version(I mean, with the disable/shutdown fixed)
of the driver could be merged already before extending support.

I'll verify those,

yes, but as stated before, I would keep it for potential energy saving.

Thanks for your feedback :)
