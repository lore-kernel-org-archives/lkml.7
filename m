I did not actually suggest dropping the old parameters.  I said I
wasn't sure the user confusion of deprecating the old names in favor
of new names was worth the trouble.  I suspect we should just *add*
one new parameter and leave the old ones unchanged.

What I actually meant was "you correctly posted v2 based on my master
branch at the time, and since my master branch has moved from v5.0-rc1
to v5.1-rc1 since your v2 post, I'll do trivial fixes for that."

But since you're posting v3 *today*, and my master branch has been at
v5.1-rc1 since March 18, you should rebase your patches on top of that
branch first.

We also talked about moving trivial cleanups to be at the end.  The
important things should be first in the series, with cleanups at the
end.  That way backporting is easier, since people may want to
backport only the real fixes, ignoring things like typo fixes.
