In our PCIe controller HW, AXI address from 0x42000000 to 0x44000000
of 32MB size and .
AXI address from 0x400000000 to 0x480000000 of 2GB size are provided
to map ob address.
First IO region is inside 32bit address and second IO region is
outside 32bit address.
This code change is to map first IO region(0x42000000 to 0x44000000).

Yes, lowest index corresponds to smallest possible size (128MB).
In our controller we have multiple windows like OARR0, OARR1, OARR2,
OARR3 all supports multiple sizes from 128MB to 1024MB.
These details are given at the top of this driver file, as shown
below. all windows supports 128MB size still we must use OARR0 window
to configure first IO region(0x42000000 to 0x44000000).

static const struct iproc_pcie_ob_map paxb_v2_ob_map[] = {
        {
                /* OARR0/OMAP0 */
                .window_sizes = { 128, 256 },
                .nr_sizes = 2,
        },
        {
                /* OARR1/OMAP1 */
                .window_sizes = { 128, 256 },
                .nr_sizes = 2,
        },
        {
                /* OARR2/OMAP2 */
                .window_sizes = { 128, 256, 512, 1024 },
                .nr_sizes = 4,
        },
        {
                /* OARR3/OMAP3 */
                .window_sizes = { 128, 256, 512, 1024 },
                .nr_sizes = 4,
        },
};
