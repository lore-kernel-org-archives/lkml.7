4.4-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let me know.

------------------

[ Upstream commit 1062af920c07f5b54cf5060fde3339da6df0cf6b ]

tmpfs has a peculiarity of accounting hard links as if they were
separate inodes: so that when the number of inodes is limited, as it is
by default, a user cannot soak up an unlimited amount of unreclaimable
dcache memory just by repeatedly linking a file.

But when v3.11 added O_TMPFILE, and the ability to use linkat() on the
fd, we missed accommodating this new case in tmpfs: "df -i" shows that
an extra "inode" remains accounted after the file is unlinked and the fd
closed and the actual inode evicted.  If a user repeatedly links
tmpfiles into a tmpfs, the limit will be hit (ENOSPC) even after they
are deleted.

Just skip the extra reservation from shmem_link() in this case: there's
a sense in which this first link of a tmpfile is then cheaper than a
hard link of another file, but the accounting works out, and there's
still good limiting, so no need to do anything more complicated.
