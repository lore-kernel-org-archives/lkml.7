That would be easiest so to avoid synchronization between two trees,
provided that all non-btrfs commits have acks/reviews.

However, as it's rc5, I'm not at all comfortable to add this patchset to
5.3 queue, the changes seem to be intrusive and redoing bio submission
path is something that will affect all workloads. I did quick tests on
fstests (without cgruops enabled) and this was fine, but that's the
minimum that must work. Wider range of workloads would be needed, I can
do that with mmtests, but all of that means that 5.3 is infeasible.

So this opens more possibilites regarding the patchset routing. Both
parts can go separately through their usual trees.
