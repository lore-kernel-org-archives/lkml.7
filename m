This description looks better. I will update the commit message. Do you mind if 
I had your signed-off-by as you provided the commit message?

I understand, I will take into account for the next RT patches I will post.

FWIW, this is the behavior I saw when testing this patch.

 From my understanding, the stack frames across exceptions are chained. So the 
stacktrace will be able to unwind to the previous context.

Actually, in my previous e-mail, I have cut down the stacktrace to el1_irq() as 
it was quite long. An example of the full stack trace:

Thank you for your acked-by and the explanation. I will resend the patch with 
the updated comment.
