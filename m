Hi Guenter,

I have a question about these super-IO accesses:

To me, it's not good that these hwmon, watchdog, gpio, etc drivers make 
unconstrained accesses to 0x2e and 0x4e ports (ignoring the 
request_muxed_region() call).

The issue I see is that on an arm, IO space for some other device may be 
mapped in this region, so it would not be right for these drivers to 
access those same regions.

Is there any other platform check which can be made to ensure that 
accesses these super-IO ports is appropriate?

Thanks,
John
