Not on this thread, but maybe on others. Since they weren't linked and
referenced, I didn't find them. Having them summarized in the patch
description would be a great idea.

"My pragmatic solution, your messy hack".

It's an awkward solution that will now be permanently locked in due to
the /proc interface being an ABI.

It definitely provides concrete gains in functionality, in particular
it provides a significantly less fragile way of providing the data
such that having it out of sync with the running kernel is a lot less
accident-prone.

That has _never_ been a good argument for picking up something that
will need to be supported as an ABI forever.

We've solved these kind of things in the past without exporting
tarballs from the kernel. We can do it again.


I literally didn't hear a single valid reason for why this patch
should go in from you.
