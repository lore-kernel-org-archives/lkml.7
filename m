Yeah, most of the usecases for eBPF tracing are all instrumenting the kernel
using kprobes.  There are some usecases that instrument userspace with
uprobes but those don't need headers.

I think even though the kernel-headers can't have information about all data
structures, they do already contain a lot of data structure definitions we
need already. And anything needed can/should arguably be moved to include/ if
they are really needed for kernel extension by something "external" to the
kernel such as kernel modules or eBPF, right?

In any case, such a solution such as what Steve suggested, still cannot do
what we can with headers - such as build kernel modules on the fly using the
C-compiler without any auto-generation of C code from any debug artifiacts.
Think systemtap working with the module-backend without any need for
linux-headers package on the file system. So such a solution would still be a
bit orthogonal in scope to what this proposed solution can solve IMO.

thanks,
