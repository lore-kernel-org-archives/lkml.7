Applied, thanks.

Good suggestion!

I agree, the interface is error-prone.  Clearing inode.bh afterwards
makes sense.

After we do this, we should also scan the call sites, since there are
some places where we have been calling get_bh(iloc.bh) before-hand, so
that the brelse(iloc.bh) in the cleanup path will work.  Other call
paths add iloc.bh = NULL afterwards so that the brelse() will work
correctly.  So we'll be able to clean up all of this afterwards.
