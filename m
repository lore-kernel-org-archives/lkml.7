Bjorn, thanks for feedback. I've added your ack and fixed that typo.

Good point. Initially those patches were coming together, but the
first one landed to master while the conversion is only scheduled to be
done. I've changed this reference to 10dce8af3422 ("fs: stream_open -
opener for stream-like files so that read and write can run
simultaneously without deadlock").

I was contemplating how to split this too. And one of the way was to go
with separate patch for every subsystem. However I still hope to do the
mass conversion all at one conversion, because otherwise it would be
many patches and it will take my time to propagate them all / ping
maintainers etc.  About splitting deadlock / just safe:
stream_open.cocci does not have complete coverage for detecting whether
a .read() blocks, and as pci/switchtec case shows there are indeed other
cases that might be deadlocking but are not currently detected as such.
I would thus prefer not to split the conversion.

I've added the following note to the patch:

    and the rest were just safe to convert to stream_open because their read and
    write do not use ppos at all and corresponding file_operations do not
    have methods that assume @offset file access(*):

    <long list>

    ...

    (*) This second group also contains cases with read/write deadlocks that
    stream_open.cocci don't yet detect, but which are still valid to convert to
    stream_open since ppos is not used. For example drivers/pci/switch/switchtec.c
    calls wait_for_completion_interruptible() in its .read, but stream_open.cocci
    currently detects only "wait_event*" as blocking.

hope it is ok.

Thanks. Your input was useful. The updated patch is here:

https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/linux/commit/a34a8a9cb2d7

as well as related patches to tighten stream_open semantic and
corresponding FUSE bits:
