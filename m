you're right.

I don't think so. There is no dependecy between
guest_cpuid_has(X86_FEATURE_CORE_CAPABILITY) and MSR_TEST_CTL.
guest_cpuid_has(X86_FEATURE_CORE_CAPABILITY) only indicates that guest has MSR
CORE_CAPABILITY.

Due to the fact that MSR_TEST_CTL is emulated with vmx->msr_test_ctl. I think it
's ok to always let userspace or guest to read MSR_TEST_CTL, it just returns the
emulated value. Like you said, " vmx->msr_test_ctl holds the proper value, which
is either 0 or CORE_CAP_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT until more bits are supported."

Again, in wrmsr handler, since MSR_TEST_CTL is emulated, it can be considered
that guest always has this MSR. It just needs to return 1 when reserved bits are
set. 

Using vmx->msr_test_ctl_mask is a good idea. I will use it in next version.

You're right and thanks for your advice. 
I will take it in next version.

Right, X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT is set in 2 situation:

	#1 the capability is enumerated by CORE_CAP_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT (bit 5 of
MSR_IA32_CORE_CAPABILITY)
	
	#2 via FMS list, in which those processors have split lock detection
feature but don't have MSR_IA32_CORE_CAPABILITY.

There two pathes work well for host, accurately for real FMS.
However, when it comes to virtualization, we can emulate a different FMS of
guest from host.

Considering the following case:

The host cpu is ICELAKE_MOBILE, which doesn't have X86_FEATURE_CORE_CAPABILITY
but has X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT. 
If we run a guest with cpu model, Skylake. It will hidden the feature
X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT from guest, since guest's MSR_IA32_CORE_CAPABILITY
reports zero, and FMS of guest doesn't match the list.

In this way, it failed to expose the X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT to guest.

Since MSR_IA32_CORE_CAPBILITY is emulated in software for guest. We can enforce
using #1 to report X86_FEATURE_SPLIT_LOCK_DETECT of guest, thus guest can get
rid of the limitation of the FMS list.
