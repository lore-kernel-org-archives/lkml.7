Idea was not to modify existing behavior for fc != 3

Also Christian already proposed to handle all FC codes. So in this idea, 
this must be done as you say.

This I do not agree with, it is typically the responsibility of the part 
in charge of the virtualization to do this, also the vfio_driver.

I do not agree with this either, the maintainers ;) will not allow this.

RC 06 means "Invalid address of AP-queue notification byte"

So you must have think about another code or I do not understand at all 
what you mean.
