I'm not a fan either, for the reasons Andreas stated; if you ever move
code around, it's much more hazardous because you now have to check if
what had previously been a "return ret" now has to change into "goto
outl".  In some case, it's really obvious, if the code is at the very
beginning of the function, but when you're 35 lines down, well over
the size of many of an editor window, it's no longer quite so obvious
whether or not "goto out" is necessary.
