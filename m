You can add plugins to handle this. See tools/lib/traceevent/plugin_*.c

For the short term yeah. And you can add a plugin to the libtraceevent
to teach trace-cmd and perf how to parse it.
See "tep_register_print_function()"

Yes, I'm fine with adding new generic functions that can parse the code
properly to libtraceevent. Anything added to the trace_event code
should have a corresponding routine added to libtraceevent. Just
remember, that those *are* user API, and once made, they can not change.

Thanks!
