True.

We had it like this once, so it is only going back to the original code. 
And yes, I think it is better.

Commit b56b36ee6751 ("livepatch: Cleanup module page permission changes") 
changed it due to the error handling. Commit 255e732c61db ("livepatch: use 
arch_klp_init_object_loaded() to finish arch-specific tasks") removed the 
reason for the change but did not cleanup the rest.

I have no real preference either. I noticed something I did not like while 
touching the code and that's it.
