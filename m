By default the table is full of 0. When a CPU is brought up the value is
read from the device-tree and the table is updated. What I've seen is
this value is common for 2 nodes at a given level if they share the level.
So as the table is initialized with 0, all offline nodes (no memory no
cpu) are merged with node 0.
My fix initializes the table with unique values for each node, so by
default no nodes are mixed.

I didn't answer because:

- I thought this was not the good way to fix the problem as you said "it
seems very fragile and unfortunate",

- I don't have the answers, I'd really like someone from IBM that knows
well the NUMA part of powerpc answers to these questions... and perhaps
find a better solution.

Thanks,
Laurent
