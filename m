My y2038 series originally went in that direction by allowing much more
of the compat code to be compiled and then discarded without the
#ifdefs (and combine it with the 32-bit time_t handling on 32-bit
architectures). I went away from that after Christoph and others found
the reuse of the compat interfaces too confusing.

The current state now is that most compat_* interfaces cannot be
compiled unless CONFIG_COMPAT is set, and making that work
in general is a lot of work, so I followed the usual precedent here
and used that #ifdef. This also matches what is done elsewhere
in the same file (see io_import_iovec).

I absolutely agree in general, and have sent many patches to
remove #ifdefs in other code when there was a good alternative
and the #ifdefs are wrong (which they are at least 30% of the time
in my experience).

The problems for doing this in general for compat code are

- some structures have a conditional compat_ioctl() callback
  pointer, and need an #ifdef around the assignment until
  we change the struct as well.
- Most compat handlers require the use of the compat_ptr()
  wrapper, I have a patch to move this to common code, but
  that was rejected previously
- many compat handlers rely on types from asm/compat.h
  that does not exist on architectures without compat support.

In this specific case, compat_sigset_t is required for declaring
set_compat_user_sigmask(), and the former is not easy to
define on non-compat architectures. I still think that the best
way forward here is to move it into set_user_sigmask()
next merge window, rather than doing a larger scale rewrite
of linux/compat.h to get this bug fixed now.
