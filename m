Yes, there is no question that we understand this concept.

The salient point is that when given an opportunity to preserve and
transition an existing development community, provide an
architecturally relevant driver and to impose no restrictions on how a
new, as yet untested and undesigned security architecture can emerge,
the decision is made to break all compatibility.

Which goes to my first e-mail where I noted this was about idealogy
rather then technology.

Nothing wrong with that as long as we are intellectually honest.

At the risk of being indelicate, it was your company that hooked the
SGX development community on out-of-tree driver ABI's and software.

We are just trying to find a mutually beneficial and productive path
forward.

On that note.

One of the issues we have raised in multiple missives, that remains
unaddressed, was the notion that the proposed driver may not work on
all SGX hardware moving forward.  Is there going to be an OEM mandated
requirement, enforced by Intel licensing, that all SGX capable
platforms will implement Flexible Launch Control?

For those following along at home, here is a link to the Intel
Security announcements made at RSA-2019 in February:

https://newsroom.intel.com/news/rsa-2019-intel-partner-ecosystem-offer-new-silicon-enabled-security-solutions/

Of relevant note is the section 'Operational Control':

"Intel is delivering a new capability called flexible launch control
that enables a company's data center operations to set and manage
their own unique security policies for launching enclaves as well as
providing controlled access to sensitive platform identification
information.  This capability is currently available on Intel
SGX-enabled Intel Xeon E Processors and some Intel NUC's".

FLC is primarily about supporting Data-Center Attestation Services
(DCAS) on XEON class servers.  New technologies are released on NUC's
since those are the platforms that Intel seems to target for developer
experimentation.

We have had some experience with legal and liability sensitivities
surrounding security in general and SGX in particular.  Absent an
official policy statement, it is a really open question whether this
driver will be universally useful, with the end result being a fair
amount of chaos for the Linux SGX community.

As opposed to Windows, which will have a known and stable ABI that
works on any SGX capable hardware.

As I noted in my first e-mail yesterday, we anticipated this and our
architecture provides a path forward for resolving this issue as well.

Have a good weekend.
