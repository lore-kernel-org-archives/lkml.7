If I understand correctly, devices below these PCIe host bridges can
DMA only to the listed address ranges, and you prevent devices from
doing DMA to the holes between the listed ranges by reserving the
holes in dma-iommu.

Apparently there's something that makes sure driver dma_map_*() always
goes through dma-iommu?  I traced as far as seeing that dma-iommu
depends on CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA, and that arm64 selects CONFIG_IOMMU_DMA
if CONFIG_IOMMU_SUPPORT, but then the trail got cold.  I didn't see
what selects CONFIG_IOMMU_SUPPORT.

This does look like what Robin suggested, as far as I can tell.
Hopefully he'll take a look and give his reviewed-by.  Thanks for
persevering!
