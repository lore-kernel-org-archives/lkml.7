Nothing against it, I just didn't want it to do that for one user,
but...

... but if you think there's a lot of existing users that really want
this behavior, then great.

I'll look into that.

The logic around ESCAPE_NP and the "only" string is really confusing.  I
started assuming I could just add an ESCAPE_NONASCII flag and stick "
and \ into the "only" string, but it doesn't work that way.
