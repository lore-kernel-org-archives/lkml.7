Rule of common sense.

For example UEFI and ACPI may have some relations, SPI and ACPI kinda
orthogonal.

Please remove this macro for good. Otherwise big subsystems / drivers usually do something like

#define foo_err(...)	dev_err(...)
...

Don't know if it would help here, the driver is standalone and not so big.

Perhaps, simple

	__set_bit(b, x)		->	x |= BIT(b);
	__clear_bit(b, x)	->	x &= ~BIT(b);
