what do you mean by bcc-populated?
bcc keeps its own headers inside libbcc.so .data section and provides
them to clang as 'memory buffer' in clang's virtual file system.

the order of checks is bcc implementation detail. we can change that later.
we've seen issues with /lib/modules/`uname -r` being corrupted by chef,
so we might actually extract from kheaders.tar.xz all the time and more
than once.
Like try-compiling a simple prog and if it doesn't work, do the extract.

Today bcc is the only tool that interacts with clang this way.
There is enough complexity and plenty of complex issues with
on-the-fly recompile approach.
I strongly suggest anyone considering new on-the-fly recompile to work
with us on BTF instead.

The set of headers is not an ultimate goal. See the example with pch. 
bpf tracing needs three components:
- all types and layout of datastructures;
  including all function prototypes with arg names
- all macros
- all inline functions

The first one is solved by BTF based solution,
but macroses and infline functions have no substitute, but C header files.
That is today.
Eventually we might find a way to reduce dependency on headers and have
macroses and infline functions represented some other way.
Like mini-pch where only relevant bits of headers are represented as
clang's syntax tree or mini C code.
The key point is that having headers is not a goal.
Making kernel maintain an fs of headers is imo a waste of kernel code.
The most minimal approach of compressed tarball is preferred.

and such header-fs would uncompress internal tarball, create inodes, dentries
and to make sure all that stuff is cleanly refcnted and freed.
imo that is plenty of kernel code for no good reason.

Fair enough. My guess that kheaders.tar.xz in this shape we would
need for at least 5 years. After that we'll come up with better approach.
