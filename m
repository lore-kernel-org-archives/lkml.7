FWIW I think it makes sense to post the HCR and MDCR patches separately
from this series. That should make it clear that pointer auth does not
depend on these changes, and should make it easier to evaluate the
changes on their own.

Others' opinions are welcome as well.

I'm not familiar with this, but James may be referring to
kvm_arm_vhe_guest_exit, which restores DAIF to a constant value. It
seems like originally the patch saved/restored DAIF [1], but it was
decided that a constant value was better.

Thanks,
