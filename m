Hi folks,

ACK. In my own experience on dealing w/ lots of files, eg. headers, in
compilation processes, there indeed is a bottleneck, when thousands of
files have to be processed, but:

a) most the kernel-side delay's were coming from actual IO - w/ tmpfs,
   that easily goes away, and the syscall overhead isn't so much.
b) most of the total computation was preprocessor and parsing.

Personally, having generic helpers for putting blobs into /proc files
(like config.gz) sound appealing. But I'm not sure whether doing that
w/ kernel headers this way is a good solution. Actually, I'm even not
sure whether raw kernel headers are at all are a good way. (can't we
use compiler-generated debug info ?)

ACK. For now, this is an Android-only debug tool, just needed there
because of it's unusual partitioning/deployment mechanisms - on usual
GNU/Linux distros, we just have the kheaders in the file system.
(and even on my small embedded devices, I either run the DUTs via NFS,
9P2k, initrd, etc or just deploy kernel and headers into the filesystem)

As Android already is in it's own universe, why can't that stuff remain
incubated there, until we have more field experience w/ it and more time
to rethink the whole idea very carefully ?

The patch is pretty small, so it's trivial cherry-pick, in case somebody
outside Android universe wants to use it.

I see two smaller sub-problems that IMHO deserve a more generic
solution:

#1: generic helpers for easily exposing in-kernel blobs as /proc files
    (potentially w/ transparent decompression)

#2: generic way for easily linking in files with very few LoC

    one scenario that I've got in mind is using dtb snippets for board
    drivers, that only need to initialize some generic drivers w/
    board specific configuration, so that doesn't have to be hand-
    written anymore.

ACK. I don't think that /proc really is the right place for that.
Actually, I even doubt that for config.gz , it's just historically
there (many distros already disabled it for many years). IMHO, /proc
is for process information. (i guess that was also a reason for creating
debugfs instead of putting that stuff into /proc).
