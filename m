raw_spinlock_t would not work here without disabling preemption. Otherwise you 
may end up to recurse on the lock and therefore deadlock. But then it raise the 
question of the usefulness of the lock here.

However, I don't really understand why allowing the scheduling would be a 
problem here. Is it a concern because we will waste cycle trying to restore/save 
a context that will be scratched as soon as we release the lock?
