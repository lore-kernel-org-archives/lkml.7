AFAICS, they are all short-lived; don't forget that slabs have cache,
so in that situation allocations are cheap.

Not if you want it fast...  Indirect calls are not cheap; the cost of
those callbacks would be considerable.  Besides, you want more than
"where do I stop", right?  It's also "what output do I use for this
dentry", both for you and for cifs (there it's "which separator to use",
in ceph it's "these we want represented as //")...

Can it be called on detached subtree, during e.g. open_by_handle()?
There it can get really fishy; you end up with base being at the
random point on the way towards root.  How does that work, and if
it *does* work, why do we need the whole path in the first place?

BTW, for cifs there's no need to play with ->d_lock as we go.  For
ceph, the only need comes from looking at d_inode(), and I wonder if
it would be better to duplicate that information ("is that a
snapdir/nosnap") into dentry iself - would certainly be cheaper.
OTOH, we are getting short on spare bits in ->d_flags...
