I have been working with bcodding on IRC for the past couple of days on
this.  Fortunately I was able to come up with way to fill up a directory
in such a way that it will fail with certainty and as a bonus doesn't
include any user data so I can feel OK about sharing packet captures.  I
have a capture alongside a kernel trace of the problematic operation in
https://www.math.uh.edu/~tibbs/nfs/.  Not that I can particularly tell
anything useful from that, but bcodding says that it seems to point to
some issue in sunrpc.

And because I can easily reproduce this and I was able to do a bisect:

2c94b8eca1a26cd46010d6e73a23da5f2e93a19d is the first bad commit
commit 2c94b8eca1a26cd46010d6e73a23da5f2e93a19d

    SUNRPC: Use au_rslack when computing reply buffer size

    au_rslack is significantly smaller than (au_cslack << 2). Using
    that value results in smaller receive buffers. In some cases this
    eliminates an extra segment in Reply chunks (RPC/RDMA).

But of course, I can't say whether this is the actual bad commit or
whether it just introduced a behavior change which alters the conditions
under which the problem appears.

And just to make sure that the blame doesn't lie with the old RHEL7
kernel, I rsynced over the problematic directory to a machine running
something slightly more modern (5.1.11, which I know I need to update,
but it's already set up to do kerberised NFS) and the same problem
exists, though the directory listing does fail at a different place.
