Thanks very much for this.

I'm afraid so.
From the HW datasheet I got from our HW designer, the description for
this pcie2axi_win_size filed is
" Possible values are 12 to 36 which means 2^12 to 2^36 bytes, leaving
this filed to 0 causes window to be disabled."

Current setting set the window size as 2^31, which means the request
from EP side could only access the address range from 0 to 0x8000_0000.
Considering the DRAM start from 0x4000_0000, that means only the first
1GB(0x4000_0000 ~ 0x8000_0000) could be accessed by EP side DMA.

This has not run into an error for our current usage, I guess because
MT2712 and MT7622 have several type boards, most of are only have 2GB
physical memory, and our test sample is not bigger enough to cover the
case that EP DMA will access fully DRAM. Or most EP device does not have
an built-in DMA engine, they may relay on the host side's MMIO(memory
mapped IO) operations.
 
Take MT2712 as example, in arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt2712-evb.dts,
the physical memory size is defined as 0x80000000 and is described by
below node:

memory@400000000 {
	device_type = "memory";
	reg = <0 0x400000000 0 0x800000000>
}

Thanks.
