Hmm, that makes sense, but I wonder if that will also confuse users,
when the log wraps around and no longer starts at [1] and there's no
way to retrieve the previous errors.

I took your suggestion as a way mainly to clearly delineate each error,
since without the [number] or something similar, they all kind of run
together.

Not sure what advantage numbering itself provides - would some other
non-numbered separator work?

Thanks,

Tom
