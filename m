I agree these issues are quite Linux-specific (*especially* the ability
to re-open fds through /proc and the existence of "magic links").

However, I feel there are a few more good reasons for resolveat(2):

 * openat(2) ignores unknown flags, meaning that old kernels will ignore
   new programs trying to use O_THISROOT and might end up causing
   security issues. Yes, it'd be trivial to check whether the new O_*
   flags are supported at start-up, but I think a security feature
   shouldn't have a foot-gun associated with it. In fact, I didn't know
   openat(2) ignored unknown flags until I wrote this patchset -- I
   doubt many other userspace developers do either.

 * resolveat(2) allows for improvement to the O_PATH interface, which I
   think might be necessary (completely separately to this patchset).
   I've been working on a patchset which would make nd_jump_link()
   transitions in trailing_symlink() depend on the mode of the magic
   link being traversed through (this would allow us to block a
   read-only fd being re-opened as a read-write fd or similar such
   nonsense). One aspect of this could be to allow userspace to enable
   certain re-opening operations by passing a "link mode" to
   resolveat(2).

 * I would argue that O_PATH should've been a separate syscall from the
   beginning, given how different its semantics are to other openat(2)
   flags (not to mention how O_PATH is incompatible with and thus
   ignores so many other openat(2) flags).

 * If we end up needing a resolveat(2) for any of the above reasons,
   then we will have wasted quite a few openat(2) flag slots for naught.
   (Then again, there are plenty of flag slots still left.)

All of that aside, what I'd really like to know is what I should do to
get this patchset reviewed and merged. It's been largely radio-silence
for the last few revisions.

A simple resolveat(2) is fairly trivial (I have a version of it lying
around somewhere), but it doesn't make sense to polish it if there's no
chance Al is interested in it.

Given some of the security requirements of this interface, I think
getting it to live in -mm wouldn't be a bad idea so folks can shake the
bugs out before it's depended on by container runtimes.
