Yes, but then there _could_ be some arm or arm64 device supporting one of those chips,
so we can not just add something like "depends on !(ARM || ARM64)".

Not that I know of. It would make some sense to provide API functions
for Super-IO accesses, but that would be a lot of work, and I guess
it isn't really valuable enough for anyone to pick up and do.

Normally, if you have such a system, the respective drivers should not be
built. After all, this isn't the only instance where drivers unconditionally
access some io region, no matter if the underlying hardware exists or not.
The only real defense against that is to not build those drivers into
a given kernel.
