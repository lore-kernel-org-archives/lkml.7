I guess you are using && instead of || because some of the caller may 
not call get_cpu_fpsimd_context() before but still disable preemption, 
right?

Wouldn't it be better to have all the user calling 
get_cpu_fpsimd_context() and put_cpu_fpsimd_context()?

This has the advantage to uniformize how the way FPSIMD is protected and 
also...

... would make the comments simpler because we would have only one 
possible case to care.
