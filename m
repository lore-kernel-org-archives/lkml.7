Hi Lorenzo,

Those drivers should still be fixed up separately.

The tricky part in this series is making the resource claim fail if 
there is no IO space mapped/accessible at the addresses requested.

However I would still like to fix up the low level IO port accessors to 
discard accesses when no IO space is mapped.

Thanks,
John
