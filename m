I think you're misunderstanding me.  I'm not talking about security at
all here.  SGX isn't a sandbox, full stop.  I'm talking about the
degree to which an SGX enclave acts like a well-behaved black box.

in fact also willing to, apply whatever mitigation that you think is satisf=

), such as retpoline. Btw, don't worry about register clobbers because we h=

There is no actual fundamental reason that dynamic linking has to work
this way, and in principle, one could even use retpolines to the call
the vDSO.  In any event, the vDSO is currently compiled with
retpolines enabled, and if we decide to turn that off, it would be
decision to be made independently of SGX.

You're counting wrong.  Your version uses 24 bytes + the stack size of
the exit handler + the amount of stack consumed by the enclave, which
is effectively unbounded.  So this whole scheme becomes unusable on
anything other than a stack that is "large" for a totally undefined
value of large and that has guard pages.

t allows enclaves "to muck with RSP".

Again, this has nothing to do with security.  With your proposal, it's
not possible for the caller of an enclave to decide, in an ocall
handler, to pause and do something else.  This isn't just theoretical.
Suppose someone wants to send a network request in an ocall handler.
With the current RSP approach, it's difficult to do this in a program
that uses poll / select / epoll -- you can't return out from the ocall
until you have an answer.
