I'm afraid I'm not that qualified to provide an Ack to this patch,
but please find a nit fix below.

JFYI, there is another document Documentation/driver-api/device-io.rst,
which is somewhat related to this update. It looks like this one also needs
some update, as Jon commented in transforming to .rst format in commit
8a8a602fdb83 ("docs: Convert the deviceio template to RST"):
<quote>
    Like the rest of our documentation, this one could use some work.  There's
    no mention of ioremap() and friends, no mention of io_read*() and friends.
    But we have nice documentation for all those folks writing new drivers that
    do port I/O :).
</quote>

This commit was merged in v4.11 cycle. And there has been no update whatsoever
since. mmiowb() is lightly mentioned therein. IMHO, just updating
memory-barriers.txt would widen the gap of information.

Thoughts?

        Thanks, Akira
