Here some parameter optimizations may be possible as guest and host ctxt 
can be derived from vcpu itself as James suggested in other review 
comments. I thought about doing all save/restore in assembly but for 
optimization now host keys are saved in vcpu_load stage in C so reused 
those C codes here also.

Again all these codes are beneficial with in-kernel ptrauth and hence in 
case of strong objection may revert to old way.

During the last patchset review [1], James provided a lot of supporting 
arguments to have these switch routines called from assembly due to 
function outlining between kvm_vcpu_run_vhe() and __kvm_vcpu_run_nvhe().
