I feel there is no benefit in this proposal and adds considerable
complexity to the kernel for no benefit. Only drawbacks - will likely
do much poorly on lower memory devices, addition of more complexity
and likely bugs, etc.

With this patch, a user can decompress the archive into their own
tmpfs instance if they want to. This was also mentioned on previous
threads. I don't see your point at all.

BPF tools are shipped on production systems. They should not break,
that you want put them into debugfs to make them more likely to break
does not make any sense.

I can summarize it better in the commit message. That's fine with me.

There was at least one Ack on a prior revision, one Reviewed-by, and
at least 4 Tested-by(s). I dropped the tags since I changed the patch
a bit recently although the user interface and the idea is
fundamentally the same. Also Masahiro Yamada is happy with the quality
of the v6 patch, I privately chatted him. He mentioned he will likely
give his Acked-by tag.

What do you mean? I meant better, as in, a proposal that works and
makes sense. Is simple, bug-free and solves the problem we are trying
to solve.

Really? Android runs on billions of devices. That is arrogant /
ignorant to say Android's requirements of moving away from debugfs are
not your problem.

I think you know this already - we don't want 30MB of active RAM being
used, that does not make much sense. debugfs doesn't work because
tools that need this will need to work even on production systems.
That you want debugfs because it is more susceptible to ABI breakage
doesn't make much sense. Not having all of the deal breakers above are
requirements.
