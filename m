I'll be removing window1 and window2 as they seem to cause unnecessary confusion

DBI region is not available for SW immediately after power on. Address where we would
like to see 'dbi' needs to be programmed in one of the APPL registers. Since window1
is one of the apertures (under 4GB boundary) available for each controller (one window1
aperture per controller), we are reserving some portion of window1 to view DBI registers.
Provided 'window1' is available in DT, 'dbi' can be derived run time also. I added it
explicitly to so give more clarity on where it is being reserved (just like how window2
aperture usage is explicitly mentioned through 'ranges'). If the correct approach
is to have only 'window1' and derive 'dbi' in the code, I'll change it to that way.
Please let me know.

Well, this is given to give more flexibility while debugging and given that there is going
to be only one config for different platforms in future, it may be possible to have ASPM
config enabled by default and having this DT option would give more controlled enablement
of ASPM states by controlling the advertisement of ASPM states by root port.

It is not harmful as such. This is just a flexibility. Also, this might be required for
hot-plug feature.
Are you saying that we should have controller getting powered down as default and a flag
to stop that happening? i.e. something like 'nvidia,disable-power-down' ?

This is the standard usage procedure across all Designware based implementations.
Probably Rob can give more info on this.

Done. I'll drop phandle from controller-id property.

Done. I'll go with 'ctl'.
