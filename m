Right, this is what I was reacting to in your pushback to Jan's
proposal. You're claiming value for not doing the simple thing for
some future "may be useful in these contexts". To my knowledge those
things are not broken today. You're asking for the complexity to be
carried today for some future benefit, and I'm asking for the
simplicity to be maintained as much as possible today and let the
value of future changes stand on their own to push for more complexity
later.

Effectively don't use this bug fix to push complexity for a future
agenda where the value has yet to be quantified.
