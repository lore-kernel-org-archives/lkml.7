Sorry, I wasn't really thinking here.  You already *said* this is
related to runtime suspend.  It only happens when the Nvidia GPU has
been suspended.

I don't know that much about suspend, but ISTR seeing comments about
resuming devices before we shutdown.  If we do that, maybe there's
some kind of race between that resume and the reboot?
