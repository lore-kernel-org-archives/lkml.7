There's something wrong here.  Either the question of how PME is
signaled is generic and the spec provides a way for the OS to discover
that method, or it's part of the device-specific architecture that
each host bridge driver has to know about its device.  If the former,
we need to make the PCI core smart enough to figure it out.  If the
latter, we need a better interface than this ad hoc
pcie_pme_disable_msi() thing.  But if it is truly the latter, your
current code is sufficient and we can refine it over time.

What I suspect should happen eventually is the DWC driver should call
devm_pci_alloc_host_bridge() directly, as all the non-DWC drivers do.
That would require a little reorganization of the DWC data structures,
but it would be good to be more consistent.

For now, I think stashing the pointer in pcie_port or dw_pcie would be
OK.  I'm not 100% clear on the difference, but it looks like either
should be common across all the DWC drivers, which is what we want.

(Tangent, dw_pcie_host_init() currently uses pci_alloc_host_bridge(),
not devm_pci_alloc_host_bridge(), even though it uses other devm
interfaces.  This looks like a probable buglet.)

(Tangent 2, devm_pci_alloc_host_bridge() doesn't initialize
bridge->native_aer, etc, as pci_alloc_host_bridge() does.  This looks
like my fault from 02bfeb484230 ("PCI/portdrv: Simplify PCIe feature
permission checking"), and it probably means none of those PCIe
services work correctly for these native host bridge drivers.)

I think this is wrong.  pci_stop_root_bus() will detach all the
drivers from all the devices.  We don't want to do that if we're
merely runtime suspending the host bridge, do we?
