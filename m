Why is this related to multipath?

I don't see why should the subsystem nqn should be the same name. Its
just like any other nvmet subsystem, just happens to have a nvme
controller in the backend (which it knows about). No reason to have
the same name IMO.

Why? if nvmet is capable, why shouldn't we support it?

That is usually the case, there is no multipathing defined across NVM
subsystems (at least for now).

Don't understand why this is the case?

AFAICT, all nvmet needs to do is:
1. override cimc
2. allow allocating multiple controllers to the pt ctrl as long as the
hostnqn match.
3. answer all the ana stuff.

What else is missing?

Maybe I'm missing something, but they should be orthogonal.. I know that
its sort of not real passthru, but we are exposing an nvme device across
a fabric, I think its reasonable to have some adjustments on top.
