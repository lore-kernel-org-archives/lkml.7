I added window1 and window2 as the umbrella apertures that each PCIe controller has
and gave a description of how each aperture *can* be used. This is an overview and as
such these two entries are not directly used by the driver.
'ranges' property gives us the information as to how exactly are window1 and window2
apertures used.
Thierry Reding also gave few comments about these entries. If this is confusing,
I'm ok to remove them as well. Please let me know.

Not that I'm aware of. If you come across any, please do let me know and
I'll change these.

>

max-speed configures the controller to advertise the speed mentioned through
this flag, whereas, init-speed gets the link up at this speed and software
can further take the link speed to a different speed by retraining the link.
This is to give flexibility to developers depending on the platform.

This flag controls the advertisement of different ASPM states by root port.
Again, I'm not aware of any common method for this.

Enabling Power rails is just an example and depending on the platform, there could be
some on-board muxes which are controlled through GPIOs and all such platform specific
configuration can be handled through this flag.
