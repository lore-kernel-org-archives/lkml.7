Yes it's a race condition.

We were aware about the non-cooperative fork userfaultfd feature
creating userfaultfd file descriptor that gets reported to the parent
uffd, despite they belong to mm created by failed forks.

https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mm/msg136357.html

The fork failure in my testcase happened because of signal pending
that interrupted fork after the failed-fork uffd context, was already
pushed to the userfaultfd reader/monitor. CRIU then takes care of
filtering the failed fork cases so we didn't want to make the fork
code more complicated just for userfaultfd.

In reality if MEMCG is enabled at build time, mm->owner maintainance
code now creates a race condition in the above case, with any fork
failure.

I pinged Mike yesterday to ask if my theory could be true for this bug
and one solution he suggested is to do the userfaultfd_dup at a point
where fork cannot fail anymore. That's precisely what we were
wondering to do back then to avoid the failed fork reports to the
non cooperative uffd monitor.

That will solve the false positive deliveries that CRIU manager
currently filters out too. From a theoretical standpoint it's also
quite strange to even allow any uffd ioctl to run on a otherwise long
gone mm created for a process that in the end wasn't even created (the
mm got temporarily fully created, but no child task really ever used
such mm). However that mm is on its way to exit_mmap as soon as the
ioclt returns and this only ever happens during race conditions, so
the way CRIU monitor works there wasn't anything fundamentally
concerning about this detail, despite it's remarkably "strange". Our
priority was to keep the fork code as simple as possible and keep
userfaultfd as non intrusive as possible.

One alternative solution I'm wondering about for this memcg issue is
to free the task struct with RCU also when fork has failed and to add
the mm_update_next_owner before mmput. That will still report failed
forks to the uffd monitor, so it's not the ideal fix, but since it's
probably simpler I'm posting it below. Also I couldn't reproduce the
problem with the testcase here yet.

Subject: [PATCH 1/1] userfaultfd: use RCU to free the task struct when fork
 fails if MEMCG

MEMCG depends on the task structure not to be freed under
rcu_read_lock() in get_mem_cgroup_from_mm() after it dereferences
mm->owner.

A better fix would be to avoid registering forked vmas in userfaultfd
contexts reported to the monitor, if case fork ends up failing.
