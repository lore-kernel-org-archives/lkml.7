This sounds a little bit similar to multiple hctx maps?

So far, as virtio-blk only supports set->nr_maps = 1, no matter how many hw
queues are assigned for virtio-blk, blk_mq_alloc_tag_set() would use at most
nr_cpu_ids hw queues.

2981 int blk_mq_alloc_tag_set(struct blk_mq_tag_set *set)
... ...
3021         /*
3022          * There is no use for more h/w queues than cpus if we just have
3023          * a single map
3024          */
3025         if (set->nr_maps == 1 && set->nr_hw_queues > nr_cpu_ids)
3026                 set->nr_hw_queues = nr_cpu_ids;

Even the block layer would limit the number of hw queues by nr_cpu_ids when
(set->nr_maps == 1).

That's why I think virtio-blk should use the similar solution as nvme
(regardless about write_queues and poll_queues) and xen-blkfront.

Added Jason again. I do not know why the mailing list of
virtualization@lists.linux-foundation.org always filters out Jason's email...
