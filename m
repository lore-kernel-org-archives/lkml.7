Intel doesn't have a singular key.  The internal reset value of the LE
pubkey hash MSRs is micro-architectural, i.e. can change without warning
on any given processor.  All current processors with SGX support may use
the same reset value, but it's not something that customers should/can
rely on.

That being said, this in no way impacts KVM's ability to virtualize SGX,
e.g. KVM can directly do CPUID and {RD,WR}MSR to probe the capabilities
of the platform as needed.

What are the other cases?

Yes, and that's why we're overloading X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC to be set if
and only if SGX_LC is supported *and* enabled, e.g. so that the kernel
can simply check X86_FEATURE_SGX_LC without having to also probe the MSRs.
