This doesn't necessarily imply the overall power savings to the
endpoint as a whole though, and it's still irrelevant to the discussion
here.  The driver is doing something reasonable that's generating host
dmesg spam.

Then assuming every link speed change is an error seems like the wrong
approach.  Should we instead have a callback that drivers can
optionally register to receive link change notifications?  If a driver
doesn't register such a callback then a generic message can be posted,
but if they do, the driver can decide whether this is an error.

What makes us think that this is the only case where such link speed
changes will occur?  Hand waving that a userspace management utility
should go unbind drivers that over-zealously report errors is a poor
solution.

Nor should pci-core decide what link speed changes are intended or
errors.  Minimally we should be enabling drivers to receive this
feedback.  Thanks,
