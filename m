Yes, I understand :-)

Yes, also understand.

I disagree.

First of all, IFF_ECHO is only documented/used *inside* the kernel, and
cannot be set by userspace today. It's documented by CAN as such:

Documentation/networking/can.rst:

   Local Loopback of Sent Frames
   -----------------------------

   As described in :ref:`socketcan-local-loopback1` the CAN network
   device driver should
   support a local loopback functionality similar to the local echo
   e.g. of tty devices. In this case the driver flag IFF_ECHO has to be
   set to prevent the PF_CAN core from locally echoing sent frames
   (aka loopback) as fallback solution::

       dev->flags = (IFF_NOARP | IFF_ECHO);

   Note that everything here is specific to a single interface.

   Also note that it's a signal from the *driver* to the *stack* to not do
   the loopback itself, because the driver will do it.

   I think in the case of all other sockets/interfaces, the stack will do
   the echo anyway, for tcpdump etc. purposes.

   The documentation in the uapi just states:
     @IFF_ECHO: echo sent packets. Volatile.
   and makes no representation about which interface, but I'd argue that
   all the flags are specific to a single interface and thus you'd expect
   this to also be.


   Thus, I don't think this was ever intended for any cross-interface
   behaviour, even if it may be on the same physical NIC.

Not all drivers can and do this, I believe. Some things don't work very
well if they don't do it, but I _think_ you've just been lucky and used
hardware that does in fact support it.

Also note that for some hardware that does support this, there's
sometimes significant overhead - not just the performance overhead of
actually reporting the frames, but sometimes also overhead in how the
hardware is programmed and used, and how TX status is extracted.

Sure, for now, for your specific case of ath9k :-)

I suppose it could be in mac80211 (perhaps debugfs?) too. I just really
don't think IFF_ECHO is the right approach.
