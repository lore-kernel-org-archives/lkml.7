AIUI, you and Andy had an off-list discussion regarding rewriting
__vdso_sgx_enter_enclave() vs. providing a second vDSO function.  Can you
please summarize the discussion so that it's clear why you're pursuing a
single function?

In the end I probably agree that's it's desirable to have a single ABI and
vDSO function since the cost is basically that the non-callback case needs
to pass params via the stack instead of registers, but I do miss the
simplicity of separate implementations.

Hmm, this is my fault since I wrote the original comment, but stating
"All registers except %rbp must be treated as volatile" is confusing, e.g.
at first I thought it meant that the assembly blob was mucking with the
registers and that they couldn't be used to pass information out of the
enclave.

Maybe something like:

 * Register ABI:
 *  - As noted above, input parameters are passed via %eax and the stack.
 *  - The return value is passed via %eax.
 *  - %rbx and %rcx must be treated as volatile as they are modified as part of
 *    enclaves transitions and are used as scratch regs.
 *  - %rbp **must** be preserved by the enclave in all cases, as it is used to
 *    reference paramaters when handling enclave exits.
 *  - %rdx, %rdi, %rsi and %r8-%r15 may be freely modified by the enclave
 *    and will not be passed back to the caller untouched.
 *  - %rsp is saved/restored across __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave(), but is passed
 *    as-is to the callback if one is provided, i.e. the enclave may use u_rsp
 *    to pass information to its associated callback.

While this may format nicely in .rst (I haven't checked), it's damn near
unreadable in its raw form.  Escaping '%' in kernel-doc is unresolved at
this point, but this definitely is an argument for allowing the %CONST
interpretation to be disabled entirely.

longjmp() is probably the only thing that needs to be explicitly marked,
I think it would be better to simply say "the callback" instead of using
``callback``, i.e. use regular English instead of referencing the param.

This gives the impression that looping is the common case.  I'd prefer
using 'goto' to show that the common case is a simple fall through whereas
the callback case can effectively loop on ENCLU.

@exinfo is optional, i.e. %ecx needs to be tested before its used.

> +	jrcxz	4f

I dislike the number of flags and values that are stashed away only to
be consumed later, it makes the code hard to follow.  AFAICT, a lot of
the shenanigans are done to reuse code because exinfo was overloaded,
but that's actually pointless, i.e. it's unnecessarily complex.

Overlading the struct is pointless becase if you make it mandatory when
using a callback then it can be nullified (when passed to the callback)
to indicate EEXIT.  If it's still optional, then the callback needs an
extra param to explicitly indicate EEXIT vs. -EFAULT, otherwise the
callback has no indication whatsover of why it was invoked.

My preference is for the latter since it's more explicit and obvious.

Tangetially related, I'm not opposed to renaming it
'struct sgx_enclave_exception_info' for clarity.

My strong preference would be to organize the code to separate the various
flows, i.e. happy common case, invalid input, exception handler and
callback invocation.  And make the common case a straight shot so that
it's more obvious what happens in the happy non-callback case.

Use kernel-doc format for multi-line comments.  Missing punctionation at
the end.  Blank lines between logical blocks would also help readability.

E.g.:

4:      /* Call *callback if supplied */
        mov     0x20(%rbp), %rax
        test    %rax, %rax

        /*
         * At this point, %ebx holds the effective return value, which shall be
         * returned if no callback is specified.
         */
        cmovz   %rbx, %rax
        jz      7f

Another case of stashing a value it consuming it later.  This one is
especially brutal since %rax was loaded with CMOVcc, which means the
reader needs to backtrack even further to understand what %rax contains
at this point.

Please use imperative mood in the comments, i.e. simply state what the
code is doing.  E.g. "will be interpreted" makes it sound like something
else is processing the callback's return value.

Putting everything together, sans comments, I'd prefer something like the
following.  Pasted in raw code as that'll hopefully be easier to review
and discuss than a diff.

Note, swapping 'long rc' and '... *e' would allow the callback flow
to save one memory access, but IMO the exception info belongs at the end
since it's optional.
