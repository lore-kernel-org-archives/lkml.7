I did like that in V4 version [1] but comments were raised that this was 
repetition of hcr_el2 field in 2 places and may be avoided.

This patch basically makes host hcr_el2 not to use fixed values like 
HCR_HOST_NVHE_FLAGS/HCR_HOST_VHE_FLAGS during context switch and hence 
saves those values at boot time. This patch is just preparation to 
configure host hcr_el2 dynamically. However currently it is same for all 
cpus.

I suppose it is better to have host hcr_el2 as percpu to take care of 
heterogeneous systems. Currently even host mdcr_el2 is stored on percpu 
basis(arch/arm64/kvm/debug.c).

Yes i missed this.
