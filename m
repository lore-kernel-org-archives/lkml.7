The original clock at index 0 is part of the ABI with or without names 
as long as that clock is always required.

The purpose of '*-names' was to handle cases with multiple combinations 
of optional entries. That's the exception though and shouldn't be 
necessary too often. Clocks was an exception because the kernel's 
clock api required clock names (though only for more than 1). For the 
rest, everyone loves making up names and bloating their DT. (The last 
Plumbers had a discussion about replacing DT strings with numbers to 
shrink them, so it's not a non-issue for some.)

In any case, I only point this out if I have other comments and you all 
can keep it if you want. I'm just not a fan.
