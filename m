FYI, today I started work on updating testmgr to do fuzz tests where it
generates random test vectors using the generic implementation of each hash,
skcipher, and aead algorithm registered with the crypto API, and tests the other
implementations against them.

poly1305-simd is among the failing algorithms because it loses carry bits when
handling long "all 0xff bytes" inputs.  poly1305-avx2-x86_64.S is definitely
broken, and poly1305-sse2-x86_64.S *might* be too.  I am working on a patch...

It would be interesting to hear whether the Zinc self-tests detect this too.  I
couldn't easily tell from testing Herbert's Zinc patch series, because it seemed
most of the Zinc self-tests were failing for other reasons.

FWIW, this type of thing is one of the reasons we made the performance-critical
part of Adiantum's hash function be NH rather than Poly1305, and for now
crypto/adiantum.c only uses the C implementation of Poly1305.  Fast NH
implementations are much simpler and less error-prone than Poly1305.  Of course,
proper testing will help a lot...
