I agree, but reworking this code scares me and I suspect it was designed
this way for a reason. I'm guessing there are a lot of corner cases and
unusual bios issues this stuff works around. We might end up fixing a
some cases and breaking a bunch of other cases.

It would probably be a lot simpler if (for 'realloc', at least) it
unassigns everything then only does one pass. It wouldn't make the code
itself much simpler but it would might make it easier to reason about
and debug; and would also remove a lot of the noisy messages. I suspect
the multi-pass setup would still be required for cases where the bios
doesn't assign a device or whatever it's doing and it was probably
designed this way to try and keep as many of the bios assignments the
same as possible, though I'm not really sure if that would be necessary.
