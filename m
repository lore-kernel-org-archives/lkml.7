So I have the same comment that I had with regard to the ACPI set: I would
really rather not clutter the top level of the doc tree with this.  In
this case the resolution is a lot simpler, though: everything here seems
suitable for the driver API guide.  Could you please redo the patch set to
place the docs there?

Reflecting Bjorn's comment on the title lines and adding his ack would be
a nice touch while you're at it.

Thanks for doing this work - this one's almost there, I think.
