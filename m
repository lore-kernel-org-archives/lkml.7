The BCC patch does not extract purely into memory, but uses temporary
directory: https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/pull/2312
I believe this is a good approach.

About structure layouts, I'm assuming you mean compiler generated debug info.
That does not work for eBPF tools as was mentioned previously in these threads:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/11/1358
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/3/11/1363

IMHO there has been good number of people on both sides of the argument. If
it were as strong of an opposition as you think, then I would have personally
not wanted this merged tbh. We do want a solution that is clean and works, and
I think this is a candidate.

The solution should be regression-sensitive imho, we don't want the tracing
tools to break, people use them. And their usability and robustness is
important which prompted these patches. For some time we have been hosting
downloadable headers for popular kernels (such as LTS versions) to workaround
this issue, but this both a maintenance issue and non-scalable, and not
robust (someone boots a custom kernel or we forget to update headers for a
future LTS release and the tools break).
