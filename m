I will accept any and all patches to sed opal tooling, I am not picky. I will
also give up maintainership of it is someone else feels they can (rightfully
so) do a better job.

Jon sent me a patch for the tool that will deal with writing to the shadow MBR,
so once we know these patches are going in i'll pull that patch into the tool.

Then I guess that leaves PBKDF2 which I don't think will be too hard to pull in.

With regard to your PBA tool, is that actually being run post-uefi/pre-linux?
IE are we writing your tool into the SMBR and that's what is being run on bootup?

Jon, if you think it's a good idea can you ask David if Revanth or you wants
to take over the tooling? Or if anyone else here wants to own it then let me know.
