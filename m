Agreed. Making it built-in is reasonable, since it will not involves any
other files. :)

I don't complain about having headers for custom boot kernel. I agree with you
that having kernel headers for debugging is always good. :)
So google recommends built-in, it is reasonable.

I meant, if we have a tarball, we don't need any operation of loading/unloading
kmodules. But if we have this as built-in, yes, this would be much easier to
deploy it to device.

Anyway, having that option (make it as a module) is not bad. IMHO, that may
be more complicated than just have a tarball file, but it is a user's choice.

OK, now I understand it.

I look forward to it :-)

Thank you!
