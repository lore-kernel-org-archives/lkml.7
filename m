I'm not really seeing any issue, at least not at the moment.  I believe
that we could just be holding refs to inodes that may not exist anymore
in the cluster.  For example, in client 1:

 mkdir -p /mnt/a/b
 setfattr -n ceph.quota.max_files -v 5 /mnt/a

In client 2 we mount:

 mount <addr>:/a/b /mnt

This client will access the realm and inode for 'a' (adding that inode
to the ceph_mds_client list), because it has quotas.  If client 1 then
deletes 'a', client 2 will continue to have a reference to that inode in
that list.  That's why I thought we should be able to clean up that refs
list in some other place, although that's probably a big deal, since we
won't be able to a lot with this mount anyway.

Cheers,
