Sorry, I'm not convinced yet. This sounds like "because Android decided not
to put the header files on vendor partition, but kernel module is OK"
Why don't google ask vendors to put their kernel headers (or header tarball)
on vendor partition instead?

As I asked above, if the pure tarball is useful, you can simply ask vendors
to put the header tarball on their vendor directory. I feel making it as
a module is not a right way.

I think if linux can support something like tarfs(or compressed initramfs)
in kernel, it gives linux an improvement not only a hack. :-)
