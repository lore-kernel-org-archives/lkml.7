If you hadn't proposed the cleanups nobody would have said to remove
this driver.  Really if someone wants to go through the tree and
send removal patches for seemingly really unused drivers, that is
a separate piece of work unrelated to your cleanup.

While something still is in the tree we should clean it up from
stuff like this.

Therefore, I'll be applying v5 of your changes, thanks.
