No problem, your feedback is welcome.

The location of the archive is fixed/known. If you are talking of the
location where the user decompresses it to, then they a;ready know where they
are decompressing to.

The headers are huge if uncompressed (~30MB). Currently we use xz compression
in the archive. It would be a huge waste to decompress everything into
memory such as through an in-memory filesystem. And compressing on a
per-file basis would be too slow for build time. Currently the build of the
archive is extrememly fast.

One drawback of squashfs (other than possibly the compression ratio) is that
this would be kernel build unfriendly in comparison to tar+xz. On my machine,
squashfs-tools needed to be installed. For users who don't have this package,
that would break their kernel build.

Yes. We discussed in previous threads that for users who really want the
archive to be completely uncompressed and in-memory, can just load the
module, decompress into tmpfs, and unload the module. That is an extra step,
yes.

We had close to 2-3 months of discussions now with various folks up until v5.
I am about to post v6 which is in line with Masahiro Yamada's expecations. In
that I will be dropping module building artifacts due to his module building
concerns and only include the headers.

thanks,
