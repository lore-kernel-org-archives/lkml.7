Argh, I think we've ended up confusing two different things in our edits:

  1. Ordering of readX()/writeX() between threads
  2. Ordering of memory accesses in one thread vs readX()/writeX() in another

and these are very different beasts.

For (1), with my mmiowb() patches we can provide some guarantees for
writeX() in conjunction with spinlocks. I'm not convinced we can provide
these same guarantees for combinations involving readX(). For example:

	CPU 1:
	val1 = readl(dev_base + REG1);
	flag = 1;
	spin_unlock(&dev_lock);

	CPU 2:
	spin_lock(&dev_lock);
	if (flag == 1)
		val2 = readl(dev_base + REG2);

In the case that CPU 2 sees the updated flag, do we require that CPU 1's readl()
reads from the device first? I'm not sure that RISC-V's implementation ensures
that readl() is ordered with a subsequent spin_unlock().

For (2), we would need to make this part of LKMM if we wanted to capture
the precise semantics here (e.g. by using the 'prop' relation to figure out
which writes are ordered by a writel). This is a pretty significant piece of
work, so perhaps just referring informally to propagation would be better for
the English text.
