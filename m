Nice catch Igor, I hadn't thought of that.

Nevertheless, here is what I think: In the absence of a flush we don't
need to enforce ordering so we don't care about recovering the older
gc'ed write. If we completed a flush after the user write, we should
have already invalidated the gc mapping and hence will not recover it.
Let me know if I am missing something.
