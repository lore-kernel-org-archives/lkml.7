It is a fairly large number.

$ git grep -w -P '__[us](?:8|16|32|64)' include/linux/ | wc -l
2318

It's a rather large number of patches though to make all the
actual function definitions match the declarations that are
spread around the kernel sources as well.

Whatever struct member uses of possible temporary assignments
could also be changed to match.

Perhaps it's a lot of churn for relatively little benefit
though I do find __ prefixes unsightly when unnecessary.

A gradual conversion would eventually help isolate uapi uses
in the kernel sources.
