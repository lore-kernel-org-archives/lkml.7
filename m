I don't care much whether it's ac_split_lock or split_lock_detect, but _val
is a completely bogus and unintuitive name. The variable tells whether the
functionality is enabled or not. Then do not name it $prefix_val, which can
mean anything. Name it $prefix_enable, which makes it entirely clear what
this is about.

And please make it type bool so you don't need any of these defines either.

It's still pointless.

No. The function you want to share between init code and sysfs is

    split_lock_update_msr()
    {
 	if (split_lock_enable)
 		msr_set_bit(...)
 	else
 		msr_clear_nit(...)
    }

That's all. No duplicated code. No convoluted helper function,
nothing. Simple straight forward readable code.

Care to read carefully what I wrote? Hint: pr_fmt

What about the init / feature detection sequence which you snipped from the
reply?

Thanks,
