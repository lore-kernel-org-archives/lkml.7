Well, at least that's forward progress.  I don't know what pstore is or
what connection it has to the USB subsystem.  Does the machine hang 
similarly if you boot without the Comtrol PCI card present?

For that matter, what happens if you remove EHCI from the kernel 
configuration completely?

The UEFI and the legacy BIOS are two separate pieces of code with no 
particular connection to one another.  It's a good bet that they do 
pretty much everything differently.

As for how the PCI card affects the USB handoff, it depends on how the
BIOS behaves.  Normally the BIOS will take control of all the available
EHCI controllers during bootup (so that it can use them to communicate
with a USB keyboard or mouse), including controllers on add-on PCI
cards as well as those on the motherboard.  When the kernel starts up,
it tries to take ownership of the controllers away from the BIOS
(that's the handoff) so that Linux can use them.  However, if the BIOS
was never tested for handoff of USB controllers on add-on PCI cards, it
could easily have a bug that would crash the machine.
