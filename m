Nits, probably Lorenzo will fix them up unless he sees more substantive
things.

Ideally, use "imperative mood", i.e., write it as a command:

  Add support for Amazon's Annapurna Labs PCIe driver.

I didn't communicate my point very clearly.  The above four lines
should either be (1) a single paragraph, wrapped to fill the entire
width, or (2) two paragraphs, with a blank line before "All
subordinate buses ..."

The fact that "... by the driver" ends in the middle of the line
suggests that it's the end of the paragraph, but the fact that there's
no blank line following suggests that it's not.  So it creates an
unnecessary hiccup for the reader.

s/mcfg/MCFG/ since "MCFG" is an ACPI table ID, not a word.
