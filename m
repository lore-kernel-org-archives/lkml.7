Thanks for your quick reply, I will study BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE in detail

because we set the device state to blocked,
scsi_queue_rq-->prep_to_mq(return BLK_STS_RESOURCE)
	     -->out_put_budget  transfer BLK_STS_RESOURCE to BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE
In this situtation, the request does not send to the driver.


If the device use sq, when we we set the device state to blocked and test dd, it will continue to
call blk_delay_queue.


If this test case really matters for you, we should try to run the hw queues after set state
to 'running'.
--->Maybe we should call blk_mq_run_hw_queue in scsi_device_set_state?
