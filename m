Same comment as on patch 02: I would keep the abstracts as a chapter,
in order to make them visible at the index, as this may help readers
to quickly look at the document's contents.

I'm sure other APCI documents also have abstracts. So, please consider
this comment also for the other docs.

Anyway, this is just a suggestion. I'm also fine with the above.
Either way, for the conversion itself:
