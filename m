#UD for opt-out, a.k.a. non-debug, enclaves.  Delivered "normally" for
opt-in debug enclaves, except they're fault-like instead of trap-like.

Not really, because a user could set a code breakpoint on the AEX or
insert an INT3, e.g. to break on exit from the enclave.

Theoretically the kernel could cross-reference addresses to determine
whether or not a DRx match occurred on an enclave address, but a) that'd
be pretty ugly to implement and b) there would still be ambiguity, e.g. if
there's a code breakpoint on the AEX and a #DB occurs in the enclave, then
DR6 will record both the in-enclave DRx match and the AEX (non-enclave)
DRx match.

Hmm, I'm pretty sure any fault that is 100% in the domain of the enclave
should result in fixup.

Here are a few use cases off the top of my head that would require the
enclave's runtime to intercept the signal, either to reenter the enclave
or to feed the fault into the enclave's handler:

  - Handle EPC invalidation, e.g. due to VM migration, while a thread is
    in the enclave since the resulting #PF can occur inside the enclave.

  - During enclave development, configure the runtime to call into the
    enclave on any exception so that the enclave can dump register state.

  - Implement copy-on-write or lazy allocation using SGX2 instructions,
    which would require feeding the #PF back into the enclave.  Purely
    theoretical AFAIK, but lazy allocation in particular could be
    interesting, e.g. don't allocate .bss pages at startup time.

  - An enclave and its runtime might feed #UDs back into the enclave,
    e.g. to run an unmodified binary in an enclave by wrapping it in a
    shim of sorts.
