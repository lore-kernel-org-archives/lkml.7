It's not 100% reproducible, but it's at least 90% so it's not difficult for me
to test at all.

Also, reverting this commit makes no difference either. Note that while that
commit only changed nouveau, scheduled_work() is exactly how a number of other
drivers (i915 for instance) handle reprobing like this as well. The reason
being that we can't do full connector reprobing in our runtime resume thread
because we could deadlock if someone else is holding a modesetting lock we
need and waiting on us to resume at the same time (there's a number of other
bug fixes in nouveau for other issues caused by the same deadlock scenario). 

I'm confused here though, it sounds like you're running under the assumption
that PCI devices like this aren't reset into a clean state during a system
reboot, is that correct?
