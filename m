Hmm, at this point I'd say just ignore the comment entirely.  It's
something we need to sort out in the "official" series anyways.

No, I was saying that rather than do the backtick markup on callback,
just say "the callback".  The copious amount of markup makes it difficult
to read the raw text.

Except that looping is only done when using a callback, and that most
definitely is not the common case.

Because an enclave *could* choose a different route?  The cost is
essentially one memory access, which is likely offset by the fact that
the callback can directly check %rcx for the exit reason.  You are not
the sole consumer of this code.

a) You've argued multiple times this isn't performance critical code.

b) A straight shot is optimal for the common case where userspace is not
   using a callback.

c) The performance difference is something like one or two memory accesses.
   That's peanuts compared to how readable the code is by people without
   prior knowledge of exactly what this code is doing.

The latter, because exinfo is optional, as stated above.
