I think we do in fact resume PCI devices before shutdown.  Here's the
path I'm looking at:

  device_shutdown
    pm_runtime_get_noresume
    pm_runtime_barrier
    dev->bus->shutdown
      pci_device_shutdown
        pm_runtime_resume
          __pm_runtime_resume(dev, 0)
            rpm_resume(dev, 0)
              __update_runtime_status(dev, RPM_RESUMING)
              callback = RPM_GET_CALLBACK(dev, runtime_resume)
              rpm_callback(callback, dev)
                __rpm_callback
                  pci_pm_runtime_resume
                    drv->pm->runtime_resume
                      nouveau_pmops_runtime_resume
                        nouveau_do_resume
                        schedule_work(hpd_work)   # <---
                        ...
                        nouveau_display_hpd_work
                          pm_runtime_get_sync
                          drm_helper_hpd_irq_event
                          pm_runtime_mark_last_busy
                          pm_runtime_put_sync

I'm curious about that "schedule_work(hpd_work)" near the end because
no other drivers seem to use schedule_work() in the runtime_resume
path, and I don't know how that synchronizes with the shutdown
process.  I don't see anything that waits for
nouveau_display_hpd_work() to complete, so it seems like something
that could be a race.

I wonder this problem would be easier to reproduce if you added a
sleep in nouveau_display_hpd_work() as in the first hunk below, and I
wonder if the problem would then go away if you stopped scheduling
hpd_work as in the second hunk?  Obviously the second hunk isn't a
solution, it's just an attempt to figure out if I'm looking in the
right area.
