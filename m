Thinking again on this, i can drop that patch and just add a new
bio_add_page_from_gup() and then it would be much more obvious that
only very few places need to use that new version and they are mostly
obvious places. It is usualy GUP then right away add the pages to bio
or bvec.

We can probably add documentation around GUP explaining that if you
want to build a bio or bvec from GUP you must pay attention to which
function you use.

Also pages going in a bio are not necessarily written too, they can
be use as source (writting to block) or as destination (reading from
block). So having all of them with refcount bias as GUP would muddy
the water somemore between pages we can no longer clean (ie GUPed)
and those that are just being use in regular read or write operation.

Cheers,
Jérôme
