Subject: [PATCH v3 00/11] Add support for Orange Pi 3
Date:   Thu, 11 Apr 2019 12:19:40 +0200

From: Ondrej Jirman <megous@megous.com>

This series implements support for Xunlong Orange Pi 3 board.

Unfortunately, this board needs some small driver patches, so I have
split the boards DT patch into chunks that require patches for drivers
in various subsystems.

Suggested merging plan/dependencies:

- Pinctrl and stmmac patches are needed for ethernet support.
  (patches 1-5)
- HDMI support was changed, please review. (patches 6-8)
- brcmfmac patch 9, fixing firmware file selection, can be merged
  now, after review, as it doesn't depend on anything (please
  review :))
- mmc1 pinconf (patch 10) can probably be merged now, too (it will
  certainly be used soon by all the other WiFi featuring boards
  based on H6)
- WiFi dts patch will have to wait for H6 RTC patches, which in turn
  depend on ChenYu's RTC series, to be merged. That will take a
  while yet. I'm just keeping it in the series for completness.
  (patch 11)

This patch is also needed to not get segfault on boot (it was already
merged): 
  https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/4/5/856

Changes in v2:
- added dt-bindings documentation for the board's compatible string
  (suggested by Clement)
- addressed checkpatch warnings and code formatting issues (on Maxime's
  suggestions)
- stmmac: dropped useless parenthesis, reworded description of the patch
  (suggested by Sergei)
- drop useles dev_info() about the selected io bias voltage
- docummented io voltage bias selection variant macros
- wifi: marked WiFi DTS patch and realted mmc1_pins as "DO NOT MERGE",
  because wifi depends on H6 RTC support that's not merged yet (suggested
  by Clement)
- added missing signed-of-bys
- changed &usb2otg dr_mode to otg, and added a note about VBUS
- improved wording of HDMI driver's DDC power supply patch

Changes in v3:
- dropped already applied patches
- changed pinctrl I/O bias selection constants to enum and renamed
- added /omit-if-no-ref/ to mmc1_pins
- made mmc1_pins default pinconf for mmc1 in H6 dtsi
- move ddc-supply to HDMI connector node, updated patch descriptions,
  changed dt-bindings docs

Please take a look.

thank you and regards,
  Ondrej Jirman
