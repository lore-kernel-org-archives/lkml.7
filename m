Agreed. As I had mentioned earlier, the driver changes are orthogonal:
the drivers should request the IO region before accessing it, primarily
to avoid conflicting accesses by multiple drivers in parallel. For
example, the f71882fg driver supports chips which implement hardware
monitoring as well as watchdog functionality, and both the hwmon
and the watchdog driver may try to access the io space.

If and how the system ensures that the IO region exists and/or that 
inb() always succeeds is a different question. I would prefer a less
complex solution than the one suggested here, but that is my personal
opionion.
