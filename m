Hi,

this is the second spin of a patch set that aims to complete the Armada
DRM binding documentation. Compared to the first version it omits the
display-subsystem node and thus is somewhat simpler. Also, the
reserved-mem property has been moved to a separate documentation file.

The he individual patches are accompanied by more detailed change logs.

What is documented corresponds to the armada-devel branch of
git://git.armlinux.org.uk/~rmk/linux-arm.git with these differencies:

* Documentation of the bus-width property of the LCDC
* The MMP2 compatible strings.

Patches to the driver for the above were sent out separately.

Lubo
