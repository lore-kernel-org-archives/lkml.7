What does the spec say about this?  Is hardware supposed to support
MSI for PME?  Given that MSI Wind U-100 and Tegra194 are the only two
cases we know about where PME via MSI isn't supported, it seems like
there must be either a requirement for that or some mechanism for the
OS to figure this out, e.g., a capability bit.

I think saving the pp->root_bus pointer as Jisheng's patch does is a
sub-optimal solution.  If we figure out how to save the
pci_host_bridge pointer, we automatically get the root bus pointer as
well.

It may require some restructuring to save the pci_host_bridge pointer,
but I doubt it's really *impossible*.

My point is that these APIs should be called from driver .remove()
methods, not from .runtime_suspend() methods.
