Hi Enrico,

I added the NTB maintainers, who will deal with these, but since
you're fixing pedantic issues, I'll give you some pedantic comments :)

The first is that you might put something here in the commit log, eg,
"fix Kconfig help text indentation" or whatever you're doing.

The usual spelling is "PCIe" instead of "PCI-E".

s/Non-transparent bridge/non-transparent bridge/

A "point-to-point PCIe bus" is usually called a "PCIe Link".

s/ntb hardware/NTB hardware/

(I think it makes sense to use "ntb" when referring to the driver,
since that's its name, but when referring to the hardware, "NTB" is
being used as an acronym and probably should be capitalized.)

s/correctly//
s/proper//

I always think "correct" and "proper" are sort of useless in comments.
Who wants to write incorrect or improper code?  Besides, they don't
convey any specific information.

Capitalize "smbus/SMBus" consistently.  I think "SMBus" is typical.
