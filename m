bio split is one important IO model in block layer, which simplifies
stacked driver(dm, md, bcache, ...) a lot.

It is very reasonable to apply the queue limits in its. make_request_fn().

Otherwise, it will cause huge mess in stacking driver if queue limits
are applied in bio_add_page(), see previous .merge_bvec_fn's implementation
in these stacking drivers.

Not only bio_add_page(), there is also bio clone involved.

bio_add_page() is absolutely the fast path, and it is much more efficient
to apply the limit just once in the queue's .make_request_fn.
