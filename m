The idea behind multiplying by 2 is, entry latency + exit latency = 2* 
exit latency, i.e.,
using exit latency = entry latency
So in effect, we are using target residency + 2 * exit latency for 
timeout of timer.
Latency is generally <=10% of residency. I have tried to be conservative 
by including latency
factor in computation for timeout. Thus, this formula will give slightly 
greater value compared
to directly using residency of target state.
