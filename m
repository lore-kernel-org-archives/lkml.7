If there are no other requirements other than being in window1, then I
think it's fine to drop "dbi" here. From what you say elsewhere the
window1 aperture is 256 KiB and we can partition it as we like, right?
If so, I don't think there's a need to expose it in a more fine-grained
way.

One exception may be if other values in DT depend on the value. In that
case it would be good to have them all in DT so that they can be
validated.

Having this information in two places technically would require us to
check that the data is consistent. If we allocate from window1 at
runtime, things become much easier.

Again, I think if this is primarily for debugging purposes I think there
are better ways. If you need to modify and reflash the DTB in order to
debug, that's suboptimal. Ideally you'd want something that you can just
enable at runtime (via a module parameter, or a kernel command-line
option, for example). That will allow you to do some debugging without
having to rebuild and reflash.

Yeah, I think by default we should always power down hardware if it
isn't needed. But I don't see why we would need to disable power down.
What's the use-case? You say this "might be required for hotplug", so
it sounds like this is not something that has currently been tested? I
prefer not to have bindings that are based on guesses, because that is
likely to result in bindings that don't actually meet the real
requirements and that becomes nasty to maintain in the long run. So if
we don't currently have a case where we need to keep the controller
powered on, let's just disable them by default and drop this from the
bindings. We can always add this back in a backwards-compatible manner
if it turns out that we do need it. At that point we'll also have more
data about the context, so we can design better bindings.

If everyone does this, I suppose it's fine. Maybe Rob can confirm that
this is really the way it was meant to be, or whether we should take
action now before propagating this any further.
