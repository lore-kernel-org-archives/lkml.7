Yes, my target is to produce a subsystem that meets many (all would be nice)
requirements, including yours.  Whilst I'm happy to debate this for ever, I=
'm not
sure we are making any substantial progress.  As you mention below we
probably need to 'see the code' to drive the discussion forwards.

>=20
> Different goals usually lead to different solution architectures.

Indeed, but in this case we have your proposal which is a subset of what
I am suggesting.  One architecture can fulfil both requirements.

I'll leave it for the other thread, but Bastien has raised the case
(that I'd forgotten) that there already userspace stacks that are
capable of happily taking in both IIO and Input devices.  The confusion
here is they will now discover 'both' without the existing userspace
knowing that they are the same device.  We need to be very careful not
to break those userspace programs.

So this is an illustration of why the simplistic case doesn't work
'now'.

Bad choice of words. Sorry about that.

Any time we register a device as two types of device it is less than ideal.

If we had the true separation of IIO front end and back end then it
would be perfectly acceptable to 'only' have an input front end for
a given device.  That choice would still, in this sort of usecase,
have to be made from userspace. It's policy, not design.  If there are reas=
ons
a particular device 'is input' then that mapping should be in DT or similar.
It's no different from knowing an ADC channel is wired to an analog
temperature sensor.  For example, you could build a joystick with
an accelerometer in the stick - then the usecase would be obvious!
Hence I would also argue that any dynamic interface should also support
a static path (DT or equivalent) for the cases where is really a
physical characteristic of the system!  Perhaps the Sony parts
fall into this category as well.

For a bit of historical background, there was a concerted effort
to produced a userspace stack for IIO for android. =20
https://01.org/android-iio-sensors-hal

Unfortunately I think it died as a result of other moves in Intel on
one of their periodic shifts in direction.

>=20
> Why does it make sense for input devices?

These are not just 'input' devices. They are accelerometers. One usecase
is to use them for input.  The exact same physical device is used for games
input uses and counting steps for example (actually a lot wider cases than
that, but this one is common in android devices).

Keep that in mind at all times. There are lots of usecases.
So we need a solution that does not result in problems for those
usecases.  We are not writing a subsytem targetting android use of
accelerometers. We are writing a subsystem addressing as many usecases
as we can of those devices.

Note that the original reason for IIO was to generalize a whole set of
proposed individual subsystems targeting particular sensor types. So
that is our focus - solutions that work for everyone.  This isn't
totally dissimilar from those discussions - at the time I wanted
to do a small focused ALS subsystem and got a resounding "no" from
Linus.  Generality matters a lot for the long term.

Actually that is not accurate.  The vast majority of those older devices
that have had any attempt at mainlining are in IIO. AFAIK no accelerometer
driver has been merged to mainline input for many years. This is because,
amongst others, Dmitry has been of the view they didn't belong there for
a very long time.

That's not totally inaccurate, but the distinction in the other sensor cases
is that there is a clear 'additional' element that we can map in devicetree
which relates the IIO sensor channel to the input device.
Doesn't matter for the point of view of this discussion though.

No but it creates several problems:

1. Two ways to do the same thing.=20
2. Two sets of code to maintain.
3. Confusion over what is the best way of doing it.
4. The known issues with multiple consumers (note my solution has
that problem as well!)

My job here is to maintain the code, which is why I push back on something
that makes that job harder.

When the next usecases comes along and someone says they want to map
all ADC channels to hwmon channels because that is the subystem that
they expect to measure voltages in, then I don't have a good argument
to stop them doing the same thing you have.

As a side note we have in the past had input drivers for gyroscopes and
magnetometers.  Why are accelerometers special?

I really don't see why we should treat accelerometers differently

As this discussion runs on, I am increasingly convinced that there *must*
be a userspace policy control over whether an input device is
instantiated for a given accelerometer.   Once that is the
case then I cannot see a reason to treat it any differently from
other channel types.

Absolutely.  It should not be.  I clearly didn't explain this well.

It should be mapped to a consumer.

One type of consumer is iio-input, another is iio-hmwon etc.

If people want to map crazy channels to crazy sensor outputs, why stop them?
(at this level of the interface).

This is a policy question for a userspace script.  Particular consumer driv=
ers
could of course perform sanity checking and refuse to do anything if they
cannot sensibly use the channels.

Yes, the interface has this flexibility. Which is a good thing!  Take the e=
xample
of the gyroscope as input I used above.  If we want to add that support
in future to your driver (I have no idea if it actually makes sense)
then we can - without having to change the interface.

Sorry, I'm lost.  What in there tells you to use 'this' interface rather th=

of the other N that were registered?  I'm not sure what information you
have available there.

But it does - we aren't talking general ABI, but ABI on specific
devices.  Sure, Android doesn't care - though you'd be amazed how much
individual android device developers will because we just added another
pile of tests to their CI.

An industrial sensor platform absolutely does.  They have to validate
those interfaces.  They can't just ignore them because they feel like
it because who knows if some future user will use them?

For another case, see Bastien's reply to the later thread.

Instantiating interfaces has testing costs, even when the are standard
interfaces.

Again, you are introducing this interface for everyone. Including lots of
'interesting' usecases.

I have worked with sensor platforms with accelerometers of different parts =
of humans,
We have people do bridge vibration measurement, flying UAVs and tracking th=
e motion
of trucks.

Most are not huge numbers of accelerometers per node but don't rule out the
possibility.  It's normally limited by length of cables rather than anything
else so you used multiple nodes after a while each with their own set of se=
nsors.

There are lots of plaforms out there that use multiple accelerometers in mo=
re
or less the same place to do very high dynamic range measurement (without l=
osing
precision when things are nearly still).

Anyhow, it's not a particularly important point anyway!

There are quite a few complexities around multiple consumers that we really=
 haven't
solved.  Right now the cases that work are very much restricted.  I'd love
to tidy some of these up, but never enough time and all that.

It's not that relevant here, but in short a few of the issues are:
1) Interference over control settings.  - Two consumers need different filt=
er
   settings/ sampling frequency / range.  How do we negotiate the choice and
   communicate it to the other consumers.  More complex questions such
   mediating choices of triggers.
2) One driver is doing polled reads, the other is doing interrupt driven.
   Most drivers prevent this combination because the polled reads can lead
   to unlimited delays on the interrupt driven path and hence break it.

The main driver for this separation was to present only the 'right' interfa=
ce
to reduced people's validation costs etc.  People really do want to have the
option to strip back the userspace inteface.  Obviously these are the rare
people who would disable your config option, but the point of this was
that we actually would like to make even the IIO interface optional as
well but have a fair way to go before we can.

The difference is a mouse is only really useful as a mouse and most of the =

is a used only as a keyboard.  Here that's not true.

And how does that work on the common case of a sensor in the lid of a lapto=
p?
how do you know what angle the screen is at? =20
One oddity to note here is that until very recently we deliberately didn't =
register
certain ACPI IDs because they confused userspace by reporting two accelerom=
eters
without any info on which was in the lid.  Thankfully proper handling of th=
at
is no being sorted.  It's still mostly a case of just deliberately ignoring=
 one
of the sensors.

If we could separate the IIO front end from the IIO backend I would agree t=

Yes ultimately it would be a child device that would be it's own IIO device=

already have this for some gyroscopes.

I'm not sure there is any significant difference between you creating a map=

this an udev rule that creates the whole mapping.  Bit more to do perhaps b=

nothing particularly special that I can see.  Sure there is new kernel supp=

=46rom a generic interface point of view - yes it absolutely does.

We define an interface that covers all usecases rather than a whole set of
separate ones that cover individual corner cases.  That way we don't have to
keep defining new interfaces.

The individual drivers can easily do validation of what they are provided w=
ith.

Yes see above.  Both approaches meet your requirement (I think anyway).
I do not want to see two long term solutions to the same problem.

I'm interested in a long term sustainable solution so I want to see
the generic one.

We are clearly going to differ on this.  Bastien gave one example for why
this is required.  There will be others.

That works in a world where you can drop the previous approach as part of y=
our
generalization.  When you are playing with kernel / userspace ABI then it
doesn't. Ideally you have to figure out the extensible general solution at =
the
start because you are stuck maintaining the 'small steps' for many years to
come.  I don't want to perpetually 'have' to export all 3D accelerometers as
input devices, because we didn't have the ability to chose which should be
exported at some point in the past.

The reality is that if we put one in first that will used for ever because =
there
will be devices out there using it.  Therefore we have to maintain both for
ever.

I would love to say such a userspace doesn't exist, but reality is there are
all sorts of hideous things out there.  There are cases that deal with this
as an option of course (such as Bastien's sensor-proxy)

The number of devices that are supported under mainline as input accelerome=
ters
is pretty small.  It's not a perfect world unfortunately but having to add a
small udev script is at least not a major break if we do cause it.

Thanks. I think we need at some code for what I was proposing to discuss
much further. Unfortunately it may be a little while before I get time to
work on that.  Hopefully not too long though!
