Yes, it's reproducible up in the 5.3.0 RCs as well.

However, while trying to do some further bisecting I ran into an odd
problem.  Now kernels which were previously working (i.e. 5.1.19 and
older) are returning errors, but at a different file count.  This only
gives me more questions.  And so, just to be absolutely sure that there
isn't some weird server issue involved, I'm going to try to schedule a
reboot of the relevant server.

I know I can't reproduce with loads of short names, and with relatively
long names as well (using sha256sum as filename generator).

If I had any idea how to do that, I happily would.  I'm certainly
willing to learn.  At least I can run strace to see where ls bombs:

getdents64(5, 0x7fc13afaf040, 262144)   = -1 EIO (Input/output error)

bcodding on IRC mentioned that is a rather large count.  Does make me
wonder if the server is weirding out and sending the client bogus data.
Certainly a server reboot, or maybe even just unmounting and remounting
the filesystem or copying the data to another filesystem would tell me
that.  In any case, as soon as I am able to mess with that server, I'll
know more.
