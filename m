The idea of a system call that takes an infinitely-extendable laundry
list of operations to perform in kernel space seems quite inelegant, if
only for the error-reporting reason.

Instead, I suggest that what you'd want is a way to create a new
embryonic process that has no address space and isn't yet schedulable.
You then just need other-process-directed variants of all the normal
setup functions - so pr_openat(pidfd, dirfd, pathname, flags, mode),
pr_sigaction(pidfd, signum, act, oldact), pr_dup2(pidfd, oldfd, newfd)
etc.

Then when it's all set up you pr_execve() to kick it off.
