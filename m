Hello Michael,

Sorry for the delay in responding. We had some internal discussions on
this.

There are a few reasons why:

1. It's bad user experience to require people to fiddle with knobs for
obscure reasons if it's possible to design things such that they Just
Work.

2. "User" in this case can be a human directly calling QEMU, but could
also be libvirt or one of its users, or some other framework. This means
having to adjust and/or educate an open-ended number of people and
software. It's best avoided if possible.

3. The hypervisor admin and the admin of the guest system don't
necessarily belong to the same organization (e.g., cloud provider and
cloud customer), so there may be some friction when they need to
coordinate to get this right.

4. A feature of our design is that the guest may or may not decide to
"go secure" at boot time, so it's best not to depend on flags that may
or may not have been set at the time QEMU was started.

Except that on powerpc it also means "there's an IOMMU present" and
there's no way to say "bypass IOMMU translation". :-/

From what I understand of the ACCESS_PLATFORM definition, the host will
only ever try to access memory addresses that are supplied to it by the
guest, so all of the secure guest memory that the host cares about is
accessible:

    If this feature bit is set to 0, then the device has same access to
    memory addresses supplied to it as the driver has. In particular,
    the device will always use physical addresses matching addresses
    used by the driver (typically meaning physical addresses used by the
    CPU) and not translated further, and can access any address supplied
    to it by the driver. When clear, this overrides any
    platform-specific description of whether device access is limited or
    translated in any way, e.g. whether an IOMMU may be present.

All of the above is true for POWER guests, whether they are secure
guests or not.

Or are you saying that a virtio device may want to access memory
addresses that weren't supplied to it by the driver?

Sorry for being a bit dense, but not sure what "the device is part of
the guest supervisor security domain" means. In powerpc-speak,
"supervisor" is the operating system so perhaps that explains my
confusion. Are you saying that without ACCESS_PLATFORM, the guest
considers the host to be part of the guest operating system's security
domain? If so, does that have any other implication besides "the host
can access any address supplied to it by the driver"? If that is the
case, perhaps the definition of ACCESS_PLATFORM needs to be amended to
include that information because it's not part of the current
definition.

Yes, a new flag sounds like a great idea. What about the definition
below?

VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM_NO_IOMMU This feature has the same meaning as
    VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM both when set and when not set, with the
    exception that the IOMMU is explicitly defined to be off or bypassed
    when accessing memory addresses supplied to the device by the
    driver. This flag should be set by the guest if offered, but to
    allow for backward-compatibility device implementations allow for it
    to be left unset by the guest. It is an error to set both this flag
    and VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM.

> Is there any justification to doing that beyond someone putting
> out slow code in the past?

The definition of the ACCESS_PLATFORM flag is generic and captures the
notion of memory access restrictions for the device. Unfortunately, on
powerpc pSeries guests it also implies that the IOMMU is turned on even
though pSeries guests have never used IOMMU for virtio devices. Combined
with the lack of a way to turn off or bypass the IOMMU for virtio
devices, this means that existing guests in the field are compelled to
use the IOMMU even though that never was the case before, and said
guests having no mechanism to turn it off.

Therefore, we need a new flag to signal the memory access restriction
present in secure guests which doesn't also imply turning on the IOMMU.
