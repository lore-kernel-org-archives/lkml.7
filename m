Hi Vladislav,

I really appreciate the contribution, there are a few issues with the
formatting of the patch, thanks for taking care of those (I'll inline
the problems).

You don't need to be that "formal" in the commit message.
The "description" part describes too much what the patch is (while we
can just read the code), the important part is the issues you are
fixing.

I'd like you to rewrite this in a way that doesn't feel like you are
writing a bug report.

For instance, you could write (but you can change this too):
---
The ELAN1200:04F3:303E touchpad exposes several issues, all caused by
an error setting the correct IRQ_TRIGGER flag:
- ...
- ...
- ...

Fix all of these with a new quirk that corrects the trigger flag
announced by the ACPI tables.
---

I know writing good commit message is a tricky part :)

I am pretty sure you can paraphrase Hans in your commit message
without having to formally quote him (Hans, please shout if you
disagree).
But this is a definitively good point to raise: your patch touches a
general path, so it might have unexpected issues if not carefully
reviewed by us.

Don't take it wrong, but that's not how we give credit in a patch.
In your case, if you do not have any Elantech engineer who agreed to
sign off the patch, you can definitively mention them this way.
But the other guys (Hans, Andy and myself) are well known kernel
developers in the input and HID subsystems, so we usually take the
fame by adding our Reviewed-by or Signed-off-by tag at the end of the
commit message. (Also note that Andy is working for Intel ;-P )

If you feel that these persons have an equal participation in the
creation of the patch, you should ask for their Signed-off-by in the
patch. My gut feelings tell me they would gladly give a Reviewed-by
because they helped you on the patch, but they are not the "author",
so the Signed-off-by should be you only.

And yes, you should sign your work here saying that you wrote this
code in accordance to the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst)

Then, either Jiri or myself will have a special role, and we will add
our own signed-of-by as the maintainers of the HID tree certifying
that this patch has been accepted by one of us.

I know Hans wanted you to use USB here, but I'd think we should have a
I2C_DEVICE_ID_*
There is no guarantees that this same PID will be used in a different
chip over USB.
We tend to not car about USB/I2C for the vendor IDs: the vendors
decided to reuse their USB VID, which makes our life easier.

your mail client is playing with tabs and spaces, but I don't expect
the line above to be changed at all.

same here, this line should not be changed.

again, indentation problems, tabs are missing

the next call is "goto err_irq", which should be changed to "goto err_pm"

this should be "err_mem_free"

next one should be "err_irq"

and the err_irq and err_mem_free should be inverted at the end of probe.
