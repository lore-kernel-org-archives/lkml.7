Just provide the processed value.  We may have to fix any userspace apps
that aren't checking both.  For the raw version they should be applying the
scale in userspace.

That's the one.

It seems we are converging on a new IIO_CHAN_INFO type for sensitivity.

Fair enough.

You are probably correct.  Ugly will have to stay :(
This tends to happen when we end up merging various different
driver subsystems together like this.

Fair enough I guess.

I'd expect a probe to create a device managed by the driver.  The drive would normally
be registered on module load, hence _init, rather than probe.

I can't find any instances of hid_register_driver being called from a probe function.
