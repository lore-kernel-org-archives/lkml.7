A lot of pciehp's messages are preceded by "Slot(%s): ", where %s is
replaced by the Physical Slot Number in the Slot Capabilities register
(which is cached in struct controller) plus an optional suffix if the
same PSN is used by multiple slots.  For some reason (probably a
historic artefact), this prefix is included only in *some* of the
messages.

I think it would be useful to make the messages consistent by *always*
including the "Slot(%s): " prefix.  However the prefix is unknown until
pci_hp_initialize() has been called.  I'd solve this by keeping the
ctrl_*() wrappers and amending them to print the "Slot(%s): " prefix,
then making sure that ctrl_*() is not called before pci_hp_initialize().
(pci_*() has to be used instead).

Hm, the string was likely deliberately put on a new line to avoid
exceeding 80 chars, so I'd keep it that way.

Thanks,
