+ACPI Definition Blocks
+======================
+
+The ACPI firmware sets up RSDP (Root System Description Pointer) in the
+system memory address space pointing to the XSDT (Extended System
+Description Table).  The XSDT always points to the FADT (Fixed ACPI
+Description Table) using its first entry, the data within the FADT
+includes various fixed-length entries that describe fixed ACPI features
+of the hardware.  The FADT contains a pointer to the DSDT
+(Differentiated System Descripition Table).  The XSDT also contains
+entries pointing to possibly multiple SSDTs (Secondary System
+Description Table).
+
+The DSDT and SSDT data is organized in data structures called definition
+blocks that contain definitions of various objects, including ACPI
+control methods, encoded in AML (ACPI Machine Language).  The data block
+of the DSDT along with the contents of SSDTs represents a hierarchical
+data structure called the ACPI namespace whose topology reflects the
+structure of the underlying hardware platform.
+
+The relationships between ACPI System Definition Tables described above
+are illustrated in the following diagram::

+Linux ACPI Device Objects
+=========================
 
-   The Linux kernel's core ACPI subsystem creates struct acpi_device
-   objects for ACPI namespace objects representing devices, power resources
-   processors, thermal zones.  Those objects are exported to user space via
-   sysfs as directories in the subtree under /sys/devices/LNXSYSTM:00.  The
-   format of their names is <bus_id:instance>, where 'bus_id' refers to the
-   ACPI namespace representation of the given object and 'instance' is used
-   for distinguishing different object of the same 'bus_id' (it is
-   two-digit decimal representation of an unsigned integer).
