Sigh, you are right. Ok. I was quite tired last night when I wrote this.
Obviously, I should have waited a bit and thought it through.

Kees can you describe more the race you had in mind?

Can you give an example of this "most refcounted objects with RCU" usecase?
I could not find any good examples of such. I want to document this pattern
and possibly submit to Documentation/RCU.

Ok, thanks. Here I think in scrappy but simple pseudo code form, the struct
pid flow is something like (replaced "pid" with data");

get_data:
	atomic_inc(data->refcount);

some_user_of_data:
	rcu_read_lock();
	From X, obtain a ptr to data using rcu_dereference.
	get_data(data);
	rcu_read_unlock();

free_data:
	remove all references to data in all places in X
	call_rcu(put_data)

put_data:
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(data->refcount)) {
		free(data);
	}

create_data:
	data = alloc(..)
	atomic_set(data->refcount, 1);
	set pointers to data in X.

Yeah ok, I think what you meant here is that references to the object from
all places go away before the grace period starts, so a get_pid on an object
with refcount of zero is impossible since there's no way to *get* to that
object after the grace-period ends.

So, yes you are right that refcount_inc is all that's needed.

Also note to the on looker, the original patch I sent is not wrong, that
still applies and is correct. We are just discussing here any possible issues
with the *existing* code.

thanks!
