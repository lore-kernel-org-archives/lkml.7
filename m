It is just cost/benefit.  I am not sure the cost of maintaining it is worth
the benefit of having it upstream.

I/O memory mappings are recorded for devices. e.g. /proc/iomem so it could
be possible to add tracing for all I/O memory accesses via readx/writex etc,
configurable / filterable by device id.
