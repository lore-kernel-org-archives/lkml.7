Yes, one of the example is as below.

For Android, some important, persistent services and native HALs might
hold fd for a long time unless request a restart action and then would
impact overall user experience(guess more than 100). For some low end
devices which is a big portion of Android devices, their memory size
might be even smaller. Thus, when the device is under memory pressure,
this might bring more overhead to impact the performance. As current
design, we don't have a way to shrink readahead immediately. This
interface gives the flexibility to an adiminstrator to decide how
readahed to participate the mitigation level base on the metric it has.

Thanks for the information, they are very useful. For Android, it would
keep updating pretty frequently and the lists might need to be updated
as the end users install apps, runtime optimization or get new OTA.
Therefore, this might request pretty much effort to maintain this.
Please kindly correct me if any misunderstanding. Thanks.
