Hi,

everything you want is already available and on the way to mainline 
concerning support for various FPGA loading modes or available for 
checkout from a git repository.
All that has already been discussed on the mailing list.

FPGA loading interface is available here [1].
Patchset missing for FPGA loading has been sent to the mailing list from 
Anatolij Gustschin for various Linux kernel versions. Link to the most 
recent patchset version [2].
FPGA Manager mailing list archive link [3] - Please read up the story 
here around those patches and also the replies of the others.

Cheers
Eric
