Well, how about defining them in required dts file and group it common
regulators in dtsi? The idea of all these 3 H6 OPI boards are
evaluated in the same design consideration by adding new IP's in new
boards design by keeping the core things common like lite2 has wifi,
one plus has emac and 3 has PCIe etc. This is what I got from
Steven(OrangePI).

If we manage them properly by moving common things in dtsi and rest in
dts, we may avoid these underlying issues.

True, if the boards indeed are different but we can maintain easily if
the boards are from same family of design based my experience and few
boards do share common things in dtsi already.

Anyway, thanks for inputs. Seems like patch is applied already may be
we can move into dtsi if require in future.

Thanks,
Jagan.
