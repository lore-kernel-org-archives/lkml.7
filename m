The patch description isn't that great, and maybe the naming isn't that
intuitive either. The way it's implemented, the fsync will NOT be issued
until previously issued IOs have completed. That means both reads and
writes, since there's no way to wait for just one.  In terms of
semantics, any previously submitted writes will have completed before
this fsync is issued. The barrier fsync has no ordering wrt future
writes, no ordering is implied there. Hence:

W1, W2, W3, FSYNC_W_BARRIER, W4, W5

W1..3 will have been completed by the hardware side before we start
FSYNC_W_BARRIER. We don't wait with issuing W4..5 until after the fsync
completes, no ordering is provided there.
