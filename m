There's no reluctance to work with the community. I'm pretty deeply
committed to this, as evidenced by the multitudes of patch
submissions, discussions, and popping around from conference to
conference discussing with folks face to face.

Geopolitics aside, as explained over and over, the point of Zinc is to
just get down simple software function calls, for instances where
async accelerators aren't available. I consider smushing it all
together to be the "layering violation".

As I've mentioned before, I'm fine with merges going whichever route
is best for merges. If Herbert thinks it'd be useful to send things in
that direction and would reduce clashes and such, then that's fine
with me.

Such as... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CejbCQ5wS7Q ? November is
after October.

Anyway, I thought it good advice to not post v9 too swiftly after
plumbers, letting things calm a bit and focusing on other improvements
in Zinc in the meanwhile. I've certainly been around.

Looks like Herbert posting this might erupt another contentious thread
of bikeshedding and argument, what a bummer.
