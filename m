Yes, the new interface int this patchset is indeed not convenient to use with shared tagset case.
Perhaps we could introduce a interface to iterate all of the request_queue that shares a same tagset, such as,

mutex_lock(&set->tag_list_lock)
list_for_each_entry(q, &set->tag_list, tag_set_list)
...
mutex_unlock(&set->tag_list_lock)

The window is during get driver tag and store the rq into tags->rqs[].
w/ io-scheduler attached, we need to quiesce the request_queue to stop the driver tag allocation attempts.
w/o io-scheduler attached, quiesce request_queue cannot work, we need to freeze the queue and drain all of tasks that enters blk_mq_make_request
to rule out all of attempts of allocating driver tags. Unfortunately, we cannot distinguish between the task entering .make_request and allocated
requests both of which occupies q_usage_counter.

So to stop all of the attmpts of allocating driver tag, we have freeze & drain and quiesce the request_queue.
