Hmm... this may work (not sure if Sphinx would warn or not), but it
is visually bad on text mode. I would code it, instead, with something 
like:

.. note::

    - Only ACPI METHOD can be overridden, any other object types like
      "Device", "OperationRegion", are not recognized. Methods
      declared inside scope operators are also not supported.

    - The same ACPI control method can be overridden for many times,
      and it's always the latest one that used by Linux/kernel.

    - To get the ACPI debug object output (Store (AAAA, Debug)),
      please run::

		echo 1 > /sys/module/acpi/parameters/aml_debug_output

As this would make it visually better on both text and html formats.

I would use ``iasl -vw 6084 psr.asl`` and ``-vw 6084``.

> +f) mount debugfs by "mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug"

I would do:

   f) mount debugfs by running::

	mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug

As it makes a better html document. I believe that the focus here is
sysadmins. Doing the above makes easier for them to cut and paste
commands.

> +g) override the old method via the debugfs by running

Same applies here: I would also place the "cat" command on a literal
block.

Same comment as above: IMHO, having a single note block with the two
notes would be better.

Thanks,
