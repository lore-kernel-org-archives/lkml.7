Hi Ingo,

Thanks for taking a look (diff at the end).

I'll just drop the "For example, " prefix altogether.

Right, so I'm trying to tackle the common case of ioremap() in this patch.
There isn't an agreed portable semantics for ioremap_wc() yet, so I'm taking
a punt for now but it's something I'd like to get back to in the future.
I've tried to clean up the wording in the diff below to spell out that
this this is currently arch-specific.

From the ordering perspective, there isn't a difference, but they are very
different operations in the I/O access API so I think it's worth calling
them out separately. The 's' stands for "string", and these accessors
repeatedly access the same address, hence the comment about "memory-mapped
FIFOs".

Anyway, please take a look at the diff below and let me know if you're
happy with it. The original commit is currently at the bottom of my mmiowb
tree, so I'll probably put this on top as an extra commit with your
Reported-by.

Cheers,

Will

 All of these accessors assume that the underlying peripheral is little-endian,
 and will therefore perform byte-swapping operations on big-endian architectures.
