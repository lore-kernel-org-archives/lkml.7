If the "WRITE_ONCE(*y, 1)" in P0 were written instead as "*y = 1", it
would race with P1's "READ_ONCE(*y)".

You have to realize that in the presence of a data race, all bets are
off.  The memory model will still output a prediction, but there is no
guarantee that the prediction will be correct.

In this case P0's write to y races with P1's READ_ONCE.  Therefore the 
memory model may very will give an incorrect result.

A plain write to *y in P0 races with the smp_load_acquire in P1.  
That's all -- it's not very deep or subtle.  Remember, the definition
of a race is two concurrent accesses to the same variable from
different CPUs, where at least one of the accesses is plain and at
least one of them is a write.

I've heard that people on the C++ Standards committee have proposed
that plain writes should not race with marked reads.  That is, when
such concurrent accesses occur the outcome should be an undefined
result for the marked read rather than undefined behavior.  If this
change gets adopted and we put it into the memory model, then your
expectation would be correct.  But as things stand, it isn't.
