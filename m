To me, using bulleted lists are not a bad thing at all
but are quite the opposite for humans to read.

Not at all.

Whatever Jonathan decides is fine with me.
Mine was just a plea to avoid unnecessarily
making the source text harder to read as
that's what I mostly use.

I don't know if this extension is valid yet, but
I believe just using <function_name>() is more
readable as text than ``<function_name>`` or
:c:func:`<function_name>`

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190425200125.12302-1-corbet@lwn.net/T/

I prefer the automatic approach over the manual
marking of functions as ideally sphinx formatting
should not overly impact the source text.
