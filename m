Initially I thought of using goto to keep it simple, but I thought it would be
discouraged and hence used recursion. But, yeah.. agree that goto would keep
it simple and I'll switch to goto now.

non-designware drivers get their private data allocated as part of pci_alloc_host_bridge()
by passing the size of their private structure and use pci_host_bridge_from_priv() to get
pointer to their own private structure (which is within struct pci_host_bridge).
Whereas in Designware core, we can get the memory for struct pcie_port much before than
calling pci_alloc_host_bridge() API, in fact, size '0' is passed as an argument to alloc API.
This is the reason why struct pcie_port pointer is saved in 'sysdata'.
