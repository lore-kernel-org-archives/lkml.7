Correction:

"As such, *on arm* even well-behaved drivers like f71882fg can still 
crash the system, ...

So, yes, x86 - which has native IO ports - would not have this issue.

Right, so this is the intention of this patch.

However it would be still good to find a way to fail a request to claim 
an IO port region if none is accessible or mapped.
