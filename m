I am not sure what you mean by that :-(. All the previous series's comments
were addressed and it has been well tested by me and others. This looks quite
solid to me. Sorry it took so many revisions, this was not that easy to get right.

I did not mean to. By the way - the error does not cause any issues. It is
just find being noisy. You are right I missed this, and I will correct this
in v5. However, it does not cause any issues to the feature/functionality at all.

Ok I will consider making it -e. But please note that, the script itself does
not have any bugs. When you say it this way, it looks a bit bad to the
onlooker as if there is bugs in the code, but there aren't any that I know
off. All the comments in this round of review from view are just cosmetic
changes.

Ok.

Honestly, I prefer to keep it in Makefile.

Yes.

This does not work. I already tried it. But I guess I could generate the
script on the fly.

Sure.

It is just precaution, incase tar got corrupted and needs to be regenerated.

I don't think so.

This is needed to make out of tree builds work.

Ok I will consider doing this.

Thanks for the review!
