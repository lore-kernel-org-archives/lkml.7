Not quite. Those were never (?) there. ;-)

You'll find those files in the raspberrypi tree [1], but not in mainline. 

It is possible to run a vanilla kernel on RPi 1 to 3, I guess the 
'multi_v7_defconfig' is a good start for 2 and 3. (This works, I have a 
running RPi 3 with unpatched mainline kernel on my desk, without RT however.)

IIRC from linux-arm-kernel list, basic support for RPi 4 is still under review 
and not yet present in mainline?

So you could try a RPi 2 or 3 with mainline + RT or you try to apply the RT 
patches to the vendor/raspberry tree, but I would not count on anyone 
supporting the latter.
