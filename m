The bugzilla entry is https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203157
Thanks, Ron!

I unpacked the tar file and attached the individual files.  I think
they might be labeled backwards, though.  Compared to lspci-vvv.good,
lspci-vvv.bad contains two extra devices:

  00:09.0 PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. [AMD/ATI] RD890/RD9x0/RX980 PCI to PCI bridge (PCI Express GPP Port 4)
  02:00.0 USB controller: ASMedia Technology Inc. ASM1143 USB 3.1 Host Controller

The 00:09.0 bridge leads to bus 02, i.e., to the XHCI USB device.
Obviously if we don't find the bridge, we won't find the USB device
either.

Is there anything you can relate to the USB device?  I assume it's not
something like "the USB controller appears only when there's a USB
device connected to it"?  No flaky USB device connected (low battery
or something)?

Looking at USB, I see this weirdness:

  $ grep "BCM\|000272C95496" dmesg.*
  dmesg.bad:usb 4-2: Product: BCM20702A0
  dmesg.bad:usb 4-2: SerialNumber: 000272C95496
  dmesg.bad:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: chip id 63
  dmesg.bad:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: features 0x07
  dmesg.bad:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A
  dmesg.bad:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A1 (001.002.014) build 0000
  dmesg.bad:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A1 (001.002.014) build 1338
  dmesg.good:usb 4-2: Product: BCM920702 Bluetooth 4.0
  dmesg.good:usb 4-2: SerialNumber: 000272C95496
  dmesg.good:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: chip id 63
  dmesg.good:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM: features 0x07
  dmesg.good:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A1 (001.002.014) build 1338
  dmesg.good:Bluetooth: hci0: BCM20702A1 (001.002.014) build 1338

Looks like the same device, but for some reason it identifies
differently.  Added some Bluetooth guys in case they have an idea;
I sure don't.
