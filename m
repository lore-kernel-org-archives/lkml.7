This seems all pretty much possible, but we lack the ability to debug
this further on our side. So until we have a real root-cause with a more
specific quirk that only targets systems with a broken sbios or
whatever, we need to catch-all approach.

We can remove these quirks again when AMD sends more specific quirks
upstream.
