If you hold the lock within the kernel thread and every kernel thread
acquires it before doing any SIMD operations then you are good. It could
be a sleeping lock. What happens if you hold the lock, are scheduled out
and a user task is about to be scheduled? How do you force the kernel
thread out / give up the FPU registers?

That preempt_disable() + local_bh_disable() might not be the pretties
thing but how bad is it actually?
Latency wise you can't schedule(). From RT point of view you need to
enable preemption while going from page to page because of the possible
kmap() or kmalloc() (on baldy aligned src/dst) with the crypto's
page-walk code.
If that is not good enough latency wise you could do
kernel_fpu_resched() after a few iterations. Currently I'm trying to get
kernel_fpu_begin()/end() cheap on x86 so it doesn't always store/restore
the FPU context. Then kernel_fpu_resched() shouldn't be that bad.
