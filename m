To be fair you didn't ask if I was "happy" with the approach above,
you asked if we needed the spinlock/refcount_t.  I believe I answered
that question as comprehensively as I could, but perhaps you wanted a
hard yes or no?  In that case, since refcount_t is obviously safer, I
would stick with that for now just to limit the number of possible
failures.  If someone smarter than you or I comes along and
definitively says you are 100% safe to use an int, then go ahead and
use an int.

Beyond that, I'm still in the process of reviewing your patches, but I
haven't finished yet, so no "pronouncement" or whatever you want to
call it.
