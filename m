And this is caused by a38d1107f937 (bpf: support raw tracepoints in modules)
which renamed bpf_find_raw_tracepoint() which bcc-tools relies on to detect if
raw tracepoints are supported..

https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/src/python/bcc/__init__.py#L860

Speaking of fragile depedencies :-)

I guess the check can be extended to check for both symbols - but it'll stay
fragile. Not sure if they can do better.

I filed a bug
