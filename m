Subject: [PATCH 0/6 v3] sycalls: Remove args i and n from syscall_get_arguments()

[ Looking for acks ]

Two and a half years ago I sent out 3 patches and a title letter that
had this[1]:

  At Linux Plumbers, Andy Lutomirski approached me to tell me that the
  syscall_get_arguments() implementation in x86 was horrible and gcc
  certainly gets it wrong. He said that since the tracepoints only pass
  in 0 and 6 for i and n repectively, it should be optimized for that case.
  Inspecting the kernel, I discovered that all users pass in 0 for i and
  only one file passing in something other than 6 for the number of arguments.
  That code happens to be my own code used for the special syscall tracing.
  That can easily be converted to just using 0 and 6 as well, and only copying
  what is needed. Which is probably the faster path anyway for that case.

  I haven't run the numbers (I can do that when I get some time), but since
  pretty much all use cases use 0 and 6 and that would allow these functions
  not to need strange logic to handle odd cases, I think this is still a win.

It received positive comments but also Linus asked to remove the separate
arg pointers and replace them with a single structure and fill that
instead. But for some reason, this got pushed aside and forgotten (probably,
had to do with the fact that I left Red Hat shortly after this).

Recently, it was brought back up again[2] and I decided to dust off these
patches and resubmit them. I also added one more patch to do the same
for syscall_set_arguments() that I did for syscall_get_arguments() even
though syscall_set_arguments() currently (and never has) had any callers.
But we are told that in the near future it may have one.

The changes do optimize the logic a little, but for most archs I just kept
the same logic (loops and such) as I don't have a way to test it, and
didn't want to break the logic.

I added a new struct syscall_info that holds seccomp_data and also
includes a stack pointer (sp) field. I would change seccomp_data,
but because its in include/uapi/linux/seccomp.h I didn't want to
touch it and break userspace. Perhaps we could add the field at the
end, but I didn't want to chance it (unless others say its OK).

I ran these through zero-day-bot and compiled tested these changes for
all architectures except for csky which I do not have a cross compiler
for.

Note the following archs fail normal builds, but they fail the same
with these patches:

   arc
   h8300
   parisc64

Note, you may notice that I have "(Red Hat)" as the author of the
first three patches (even though they are signed off by "(VMware)").
This is because those patches were originally written while I was
working for Red Hat. But as I forward ported them while working for
VMware, my signed-off-by reflects that.

Steven Rostedt (Red Hat) (3):
      ptrace: Remove maxargs from task_current_syscall()
      tracing/syscalls: Pass in hardcoded 6 into syscall_get_arguments()
      syscalls: Remove start and number from syscall_get_arguments() args

Steven Rostedt (VMware) (1):
      syscalls: Remove start and number from syscall_set_arguments() args
