May I suggest keeping the bcc-populated headers somewhere else?
Ideally something cleaned out on every reboot in case kernel changes
without version string doing it.

That way you can by default prefer the module-exported tarball, and
fall back to /lib/module/$(uname -r)/ if not available, instead of the
other way around and instead of having to check creation times on the
dir vs boot time of the kernel, etc.

Anyway, that's just an implementation detail. But it's the kind of
detail that all tools that use this would need to get right, instead
of doing it right once by exporting it in a way that it can be
directly used.

So, in my original proposal I recommended unmounting when not needing
it, which would remove the memory usage as well.

If done in a location that isn't a perpetual ABI commitment, a tarball
solution is something we can work with.
