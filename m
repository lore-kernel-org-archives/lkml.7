You are right that "inarguably" is arguable if the buffer is small enough to fit in registers, and the producer/consumer also has access to registers.

Although its just 9 LOC, consider its impact on someone who is looking at
the kernel's SGX support for the first time.  Questions they may have when
looking at the vDSO code/documentation:

  - What's an exit handler?
  - Why is an exit handler optional?  Don't I always want to handle exits?
  - What value should my exit handler return?
  - What should my exit handler do if it detects an error?
  - Why would I want to preserve %rbp and not %rsp?
  - Isn't it insecure to use the untrusted stack in my enclave?

AFAIK, the only reason to preserve %rbp instead of %rsp, i.e. support an
"exit handler" callback, is to be able to implement an o-call scheme using
the untrusted stack to pass data.  Every idea I came up with for using the
callback, e.g. logging, handling stack corruptiong, testing hooks, etc...
was at worst no more difficult to implement when using a barebones vDSO.

So, given the choice between a) documenting and maintaining all the baggage
that comes with the exit handler and b) saying "go use signals", I chose
option b.
