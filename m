Certainly we could turn this into a user space tool, but its hard to enforce to find
problems early. Being part of the kernel there is no free pass for not being spec
compliant and you find problems early during bringup.

I'll think about it more and see if we could move these to places before use
as you suggest rather than a big fat catchall as it currently is.
