Hi,

there are two fixes, one of them urgent fixing a bug introduced in 5.2
and reported by many users. It took time to identify the root cause,
catching the 5.3 release is higly desired also to push the fix to 5.2
stable tree.

The bug is a mess up of return values after adding proper error handling
and honestly the kind of bug that can cause sleeping disorders until
it's caught. My appologies to everybody who was affected.

Summary of what could happen:

1) either a hang when committing a transaction, if this happens there's
   no risk of corruption, still the hang is very inconvenient and can't be
   resolved without a reboot

2) writeback for some btree nodes may never be started and we end up
   committing a transaction without noticing that, this is really serious
   and that will lead to the "parent transid verify failed" messages

Please pull, thanks.
