This series is somehow making worst when using ttyAMA0. I haven't see 
any mangling with 4.19-rt.

I am a bit confused with your suggestion. This would basically means I 
would not be able to see kernel warning. So this would impair any 
development on Linux-rt.

I have tried with 4.19-rt and didn't see a similar issue. The trace 
comes pretty clean in one go. With 5.0-rt, the trace never come clean.
