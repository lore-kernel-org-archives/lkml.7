Okay, sounds good. I'm wondering if we should maybe note here that
window1 needs to be a 256 KiB window if that's what the hardware
requires.

So I'm not exactly sure I understand how this works. Does the "dbi"
entry contain a physical address and size of the aperture that we want
to map into a subregion of "window-1"? Is this part of a region where
similar subregions exist for all of the controllers? Could the offset
into such a region be derived from the controller ID?

Under what circumstances would we want to disable certain ASPM states?
My understanding is that PCI device drivers can already disable
individual ASPM states if they don't support them, so why would we ever
want to disable advertisement of certain ASPM states?

Sounds like this could be useful for designs other than Tegra, so maybe
remove the "nvidia," prefix? The name also doesn't match the description
very well. "disable" kind of implies that we want to disable this
feature despite it being available. However, what we really want to
express here is that there's no CLKREQ signal on a design at all. So
perhaps it would be better to invert this and add a property named
"supports-clock-request" on boards where we have a CLKREQ signal.

Might be worth explaining what FC is in this context. Also, perhaps
explain how and why setting this would improve performance. You're also
not explicit here what the type of the property is. From the context it
sounds like it's just a boolean, but you may want to spell that out.

If this is documented in the DesignWare documentation, why not make this
a generic property that applies to all DesignWare instantiations? Might
also be worth giving a one or two sentence description of what this is
so that people don't have to go look at the databook.

Is it harmful to power down the controllers on such platforms? It
strikes me as odd to leave something enabled if it isn't needed,
independent of the platform.

As explained in the other subthread, I think it's better to model these
properly to make sure we have the flexibility that we need. One mux may
be controlled by a GPIO, another may be connected to I2C.

That sounds like a bug to me. Why does the driver need that? I mean the
Tegra instantiation clearly isn't going to work if the driver matches on
that compatible string, so by definition it is not compatible.

Rob, was this intentional? Seems like all other users of the DesignWare
PCIe core use the same scheme, so perhaps I'm missing something?

The binding doesn't say that the nvidia,controller-id is a (phandle, ID)
pair. Also, you already have the nvidia,bpmp property that contains the
phandle, although you don't describe that property in the binding above.
I think you need to either get rid of the nvidia,bpmp property or drop
the &bpmp phandle from the nvidia,controller-id property.

My preference is the latter because the controller ID is really
independent of the BPMP firmware, even if it may be used as part of a
call to the BPMP firmware.

Each of these entries will contain a "base" address for "registers" of
some sort. I'm thinking more along the lines of "ctl" if they are
control registers for the P2U, or perhaps just "p2u" if there is no
better name.
