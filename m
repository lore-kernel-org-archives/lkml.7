This looks like what has been added for PPC in commmit 746cdfbf01c0.

However, agreed, it's not a good approach.

If we're going to support a multi-plaform kernel for a given arch, then 
we can't always avoid it.

It seems that the only solution on the table now is to discard these IO 
port accesses on arm64 when the IO port are not mapped.

Thanks again,
