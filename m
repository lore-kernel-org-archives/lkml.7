Yes, I agree that. However, I noticed that bio_add_page is exported as
EXPORT_SYMBOL. I have no idea how many out-of-tree drivers break as well.

Is there no way to take old behavior into consideration in the block layer as well?

In current erofs, file could be break in two parts (non tail-end and tail-end blocks).
Considering this on-disk layout,
 ________________________________________________________________
|     non tail-end data              |   meta data               |
|____________________________________|_(inode) + non-inline data_|
                          ^          ^
                          |          |        
                          bio start  \-- what nr_iovecs indicates as well:
                                         the end of the non tail-end data.

Before this commit, it will stop just before the next meta data. However,
if the new bio merging behavior is introduced, it could add pages more than
nr_iovecs, thus meta data will be read as the normal data...

It is unsuitable to introduce bio_segments for each bio_add_page...
