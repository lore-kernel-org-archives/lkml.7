No, what you have provided is a description that includes details that
may not apply in the future. I'm thinking something more like this:

/*
  * handle_pqap
  *
  * @vcpu: the vcpu that executed the PQAP instruction
  *
  * Handles interception of the PQAP instruction. A specification
  * exception will be injected into the guest if the input parameters

  *
  * Returns zero if the PQAP instruction is handled successfully;
  * otherwise, returns an error.

Not really, that was directed at only the two sentences preceding the
comment.

It's obvious that you are verifying the function code is
0x03, but only those familiar with the architecture will
know the is the AQIC function. Besides, I was merely modifying
the comment you already had. You can leave the comment out
if you prefer.

I would change the text to:
"Unexpected PQAP function code 0x%02x\n"

I am okay with not checking bit 40, but I would change the comment as
suggested: /* Bits 41-47 must all be zeros */
