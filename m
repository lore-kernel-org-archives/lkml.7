Please keep in mind that this platform was designed to be standards compliant, it is just due to an integration problem that this is not the case with this silicon. So we end up with the usual hardware errata, which the kernel can fix up. I agree it's not nice, and I also want it fixed in hardware, but I guess that's the usual software guy's pipe dream.

I don't see how yet another ACPI quirk in the ACPI quirk framework(!) will make a mess.
Actually the rest of the system is standards compliant (it even uses ACPI from the very beginning ;-), so it's just this problem that prevents us from using the system in the proper, standards compliant way. Effectively we are back to the embedded times with compiling your own kernel and somehow getting a root filesystem on the hard drive.
If there would be mainline kernel support, all of this would go away and would could use standard distro installers (given they backport the patch).

That may come as a surprise to some, but Arm Ltd. is actually not really in the business of *producing silicon*, so a respin of the chip was and is not an option. I too wish it would be different, but that's how it is.

Cheers,
Andre.
