Thanks for your comments. You should find most answers in this thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20181212081712.32347-4-mic@digikod.net/

The threat model targets persistent attacks. This O_MAYEXEC flag is not
a silver bullet but it's a needed block to enforce a security policy on
a trusted system. This means that every component executable on the
system must be controlled, which means they may need some bit of
customization. Today no userspace application use this flag (except in
CLIP OS), but we need to first create a feature before it can be used.

It is very important to have in mind that a system security policy need
to have a (central) security manager, in this case the kernel thanks to
Yama's policy (but it could be SELinux, IMA or any other LSM). The goal
is not to give to the developer the job of defining a security policy
for the *system*; this job is for the system administrator (or the distro).

As said above, the definition of a the security policy is the job of the
system administrator. Moreover, the security policy may be defined by
the mount point restrictions (i.e. noexec) but it should be definable
with something else (e.g. a SELinux or IMA policy which may be agnostic
to the mount points).

As said above, stdin must be restricted in some way. You may want to
take a look at the CLIP OS patches (which doesn't only add the O_MAYEXEC
flag but restrict other way to interpret code). It may be foolish to
block or restrict stdin for interpreters on a developer workstation, but
it may make sense for an embedded custom system.

The same apply for memfd_create. If you want to enforce a security
policy on this kind of *file descriptor*, you should ask to the proper
LSM to do so. The current Yama patch deal with this kind of FD if they
are accessed through /proc/*/fd because the procfs is mounted with
noexec. Anyway, the interpreter must *inform* the LSM that it wants to
execute/interpret something from this FD, which is done thanks to the
O_MAYEXEC flag.

Again, this depend on the threat model and the corresponding product. If
you want to handle everything on your system, then you may need some
adjustments.

This is also covered by the threat model defined in the patch 3/5 (i.e.
protect the kernel by restricting arbitrary syscalls).
