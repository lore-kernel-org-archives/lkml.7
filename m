Hi Peter,

Is the idea (abstract common topology related codes for perf modules) 
the right direction?
I'm asking because I'm going to submit uncore codes for new platforms. 
I'm not sure if the new code should base on this series.

Could you please share your opinion?

If it's the right direction, could you please review the patch 1-4?
They are for previous platforms and can be merged separately.

If it's not the right time to do the abstraction, I will re-write the 
patches to only specially handle CLX-AP for now. For example, per-die 
counters can share the code with per-package counters by introducing a 
new variable 'bool die_scope' and checking the variable before calling 
any topology related functions.
But that's only a temporary solution for CLX-AP. We still need to add 
dedicated per-die PMU support later, if both per-die and per-package 
counters are supported on the same platforms.

Thanks,
Kan
