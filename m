Yes, we agree. We are working on the v2 and it is not going to depend on
CONFIG_EFI. Rather, the IMA arch policies will make the OPAL calls directly.

Right, I'm investigating how we can do that, but it looks like we should
post that as a separate patchset to avoid delaying upstreaming signature
verification based on the secure boot variables.
