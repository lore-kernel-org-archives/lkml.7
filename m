Are you sure that you are talking about the real world? I might buy the
'off' part somehow, but the 'on' part is beyond theoretical.

Even the 'off' part is dubious on a multi user machine. I personally would
neither think about using the sysfs knob nor about rebooting the machine
simply because I'd consider a lock operation accross a cacheline an malicious
DoS attempt. Why would I allow that?

So in reality the sysadmin will either move the workload to a machine w/o
the #AC magic or just tell the user to fix his crap.

Why has this information not been in the changelog right away? I'm really
tired of asking the same questions and pointing you to
Documentation/process over and over.

Thanks,
