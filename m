Well, I am completely mystified.  Nor do I understand how the commits
you identified could be related, although maybe the relationship is
very indirect.

Whatever the source of the problem, I don't think you're going to find 
it by looking at the USB code.  Perhaps the early initialization of the 
functions that _are_ present on the Comtrol card somehow messes up 
other parts of the system.
