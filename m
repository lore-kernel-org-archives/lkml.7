window1 size is actually 32MB and we are partitioning it for different purposes
like 'dbi' (to view root port's own config space) and 'config' (to view downstream
devices config space) and 'atu_dma' (to view iATU and DMA registers)

Unfortunately we do have one exception that Designware sub-system expects 'config'
property as a mandatory property. Other implementations might be having that space
as fixed but in Tegra, it can be fit anywhere in window1 (for that matter, in window2
also). So,  since 'config' has to be there to be compliant with Designware core DT
expectations, I think is it better to have others ('dbi' & 'atu_dma') also fixed in DT
and drop 'window1' and 'window2' from DT altogether. (How 'window2' is being used
is already present in 'ranges' property). I hope this should be fine.

that in near future. Currently we already have a method to enable or disable ASPM i.e.
all states but there is no method to selectively enable/disable individual states.
Apart from debugging, other use case would be that, when a new platform is designed
and if the platform's POR (Plan Of Record) is to have only certain ASPM states to be
advertised by the root port, having this DT entry comes handy.

At this point, I also don't have strong reasons to back it up. I'll drop
this for now and see if there comes any strong reason to have this support
back in future.
