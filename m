If all you want to do is document how these are used, it may be better
to enhance the device tree bindings for the ranges property if it does
not describe this fully enough yet, or add comments in the DT nodes to
clarify.

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/pci.txt, max-link-speed.
There's a standard of_pci_get_max_link_speed() property that reads it
=66rom device tree.

This seems to me like overcomplicating things. Couldn't we do something
like start in the slowest mode by default and then upgrade if endpoints
support higher speeds?

I'm assuming that the maximum speed is already fixed by the IP hardware
instantiation, so why would we want to limit it additionally? Similarly,
what's the use-case for setting the initial link speed to something
other than the lowest speed?

rockchip-pcie-host.txt documents an "aspm-no-l0s" property that prevents
the root complex from advertising L0s. Sounds like maybe following a
similar scheme would be best for consistency. I think we'll also want
these to be non-NVIDIA specific, so drop the "nvidia," prefix and maybe
document them in pci.txt so that they can be more broadly used.

Doing this via a "generic" GPIO binding is bound to break at some point.
What if at some point one of those muxes needs additional power, perhaps
controlled through an I2C regulator? Or if the mux requires multiple
GPIOs for the correct configuration? How do you allow the mux to be
reconfigured to one of the other options?

If all you have is a generic GPIO consumer of GPIOs there's not enough
context for the driver to do anything with these GPIOs other than
perhaps setting them to a specific value at probe time. In that case you
could achieve the same thing using a gpio-hog.

I think we need to identify what the various uses for these can be and
then find the right bindings (or come up with new ones) to properly
describe the actual hardware. Otherwise we're going to paint ourselves
into a corner.

Are there any use-cases besides regulators and muxes? For regulators we
already have fixed and GPIO regulators, and for muxes there are a number
of bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mux.
