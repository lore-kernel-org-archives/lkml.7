Sure, I was thinking the same thing: FOLL_PIN is clearing up, but vaddr_pin_pages() 
is still under heavy discussion.

Yes, it's on: git@github.com:johnhubbard/linux.git , branch: vaddr_FOLL_PIN_next

Lately I'm trying out .nvidia.com outgoing servers for git-send-email, so I'm 
still nervous about potential email-based patch problems. I suspect, though,
that it's really just a "must be on exactly the right commit in order to apply"
