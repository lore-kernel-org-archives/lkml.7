It looks like there are still quite a few open slots on Thursday?
Could we perhaps schedule a session for lightning talks?

I've got at least one thing that I'm hoping to be able to plug as a
lightning round topic.  Folks may remember that a year or two ago I
had given an LSF/MM talk about changes to the block layer to support
inline encryption engines[1] (where the data gets encrypted/decrypted
between the DMA engine and the storage device, typically EMCC/UFS
flash).

[1]  https://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=148190956210784&w=2

Between the Android team really trying to get aligned with upstream,
and multiple SOC vendors interested in providing inline encryption
support in hardware, we (finally) have a few engineers who have been
on implementing this design for the past few months.  If all goes
well, hopefully RFC patches will be published on linux-block,
linux-fsdevel, and linux-fscrypto by early next week.  Assuming this
happens on schedule, it would be perfect for a lightning talk, with
the goal of commending this patch series for feedback.
