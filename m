 GPIO support

 ACPI 5 introduced two new resources to describe GPIO connections: GpioIo
 and GpioInt. These resources can be used to pass GPIO numbers used by
 the device to the driver. ACPI 5.1 extended this with _DSD (Device
 Specific Data) which made it possible to name the GPIOs among other things.

 The MFD devices register their children as platform devices. For the child
 devices there needs to be an ACPI handle that they can use to reference
 parts of the ACPI namespace that relate to them. In the Linux MFD subsystem
 we provide two ways:

-	o The MFD cell can specify the ACPI id of the device.
+  - The children share the parent ACPI handle.
+  - The MFD cell can specify the ACPI id of the device.
 
 For the first case, the MFD drivers do not need to do anything. The
 resulting child platform device will have its ACPI_COMPANION() set to point
 to the parent device.
