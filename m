  Hi Benjamin,

Thank you for looking at this.

Basically correct. To be a bit more precise, there are currently two
hid-devices and two drivers (touchbar and als) involved, with
connections as follows (pardon the ugly ascii art):

  hdev1  ---  tb-drv
           /
          /
         /
  hdev2  ---  als-drv

i.e. the touchbar driver talks to both hdev's, and hdev2's events
(reports) are processed by both drivers (though each handles different
reports).

Yes, I think I understand, and I think this can work. Basically,
instead of demux'ing at the hid-driver level as I am doing now (i.e.
the iBridge hid-driver forwarding calls to the sub-hid-drivers), we
demux at the hid-device level (events forwarded from iBridge hdev to
all "virtual" sub-hdev's, and requests from sub-hdev's forwarded to
the original hdev via an iBridge ll_driver attached to the
sub-hdev's).

So I would need to create 3 new "virtual" hid-devices (instances) as
follows:

  hdev1  ---  vhdev1  ---  tb-drv
                        /
          --  vhdev2  --
         /
  hdev2  ---  vhdev3  ---  als-drv

(vhdev1 is probably not strictly necessary, but makes things more
consistent).

Agreed: let's first get the overall strategy stabilized (also so I
can avoid having to rewrite the code too many more times ;-) ).

Wasn't aware of this change - thanks. Yes, with that the warning
message should be gone and this fixup can be avoided.

One thing I find strange, though, is that while 94a9992f7dbd changes
the condition at which the warning is emitted, it still truncates the
value to 32 bits, albeit completely silently now for lengths between
32 and 256 bits. I.e. I'm somewhat surprised that hid_field_extract()
(and __extract() ) weren't updated to actually return the full values
for longer fields. Either that, or the callers of hid_field_extract()
changed to read longer fields in 32 bit chunks.


  Cheers,

  Ronald
