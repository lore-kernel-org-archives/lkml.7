Exactly. Intel hardware has PCIe ports on CPU side (these are called
PEG, PCI Express Graphics, ports), and the PCH side. I think the IP is
still the same.

Or the PCI config space of the GPU when the parent root port is in D3hot
(as it is the case here). Also then the GPU config space is not
accessible.

I took a look at the HP Omen ACPI tables which has similar problem and
there is also check for Windows 7 (but not Linux) so I think one
alternative workaround would be to add these devices into
acpi_osi_dmi_table[] where .callback is set to dmi_disable_osi_win8 (or
pass 'acpi_osi="!Windows 2012"' in the kernel command line).
