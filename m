Since this is a host controller driver and the device as such is sitting on platform
bus instead of PCIe bus, is it still the case that .runtime_suspend() and
.runtime_resume() of this driver get called when devices on PCIe bus are idle?

Having asked that, I start to feel what I'm doing as part of .runtime_suspend() and
.runtime_resume() doesn't really justify these API names. Since I know where I'm
calling pm_runtime_get/put_sync() APIs (which eventually call .runtime_resume/suspend())
I should probably move the content of these APIs before calling pm_runtime_get/put_sync().
Do you agree with that?
