Yes, it would be nice to have a generic library to manage all the
resources, but right now we don't and it's unfair to expect us to take
on this work to get the features we care about merged. Right now, it's
not at all unsafe as the client is quite capable of ensuring it has the
resources for the MSI library. The changes for ntb_transport to ensure
this are quite reasonable.

Sure, I'll add a short blurb for v3. Though, I noticed it's quite out of
date since your changes. Especially in the ntb_tool section...

Yes, will change for v3.

Faster, maybe, but I would not consider this simpler. It's much more
complicated to reason about and ensure it's correct. I prefer my way
because I don't care about speed, but I do care about readability.

Gross. Well, given that ntb_transport doesn't even support this and we
don't really have a sensible library to transfer this information, I'm
going to leave it as is for now. Someone can update ntb_msi when they
update ntb_transport, preferably after we have a nice library to handle
the transfers for us seeing I absolutely do not want to replicate the
mess in ntb_perf.

Actually, if we had a generic spad/msg communication library, it would
probably be better to have a common ntb_mw_set_trans() function that
uses the communications library to send the data and automatically call
ntb_peer_mw_set_trans() on the peer. That way we don't have to push this
mess into the clients.

See above.

Well, we can table that for when ntb_msi supports the peer MW setting
functions.

Yes, as above I'll fix it for v3.

Fixed for v3.
