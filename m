See my response to Miklos.  Even if some processes had the key in their keyring
and some didn't, which isn't the case on Android since on Android the fscrypt
keys are placed in a "global" keyring, there's still only one cached inode per
file/directory/symlink, and it either has the key (->i_crypt_info != NULL) or it
doesn't (i_crypt_info == NULL).  And it can only go from ->i_crypt_info == NULL
to ->i_crypt_info != NULL, not vice versa.

Also to be clear, there are other fscrypt users besides Android.  E.g. Chrome OS
where it replaced eCryptfs for home directory encryption and was actually the
original use case, people using it on "regular" Linux distros like Ubuntu via
the userspace tool https://github.com/google/fscrypt, and Richard using UBIFS
encryption on embedded devices.  It's not just for Android.

On Android, the fscrypt keys are removed when you switch users on a multi-user
device, or when you turn off work mode on a device with a work profile.  This is
currently accompanied by a 'sync && echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches', so the
inodes get evicted too and the files revert to their ciphertext "view".  I'd
like to replace this with my proposed new ioctl FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
which avoids the drop_caches hack: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10821455/.

As noted in my other response, a better solution (if this is really needed at
all) would probably be to move a stripped-down version of fscrypt_d_revalidate()
to the VFS, so fscrypt won't need to use any dentry_operations at all.
