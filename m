Well, technically, that's not quite right.  It's only assigned in one
location, and we hold j_state_lock, yes.  But that's because we need
to access journal->j_head.  At the point where we set t_log_start, the
transaction has already been locked down (transaction->t_state >
T_LOCKED).

Similarly, we happen to be holding j_state where it is currently being
accessed, but it's not because we needed the lock in order to access
t_log_start safely.

And again, not really.  The primary place where t_start is set is when
the transaction is firstt created, before it's visible anywhere else.
after that, it is used exclusively by the commit thread, and so no
locking is necessary.  It's true that in the places where it is used,
j_state_lock happens to be taken, but it's strictly not necessary.

Yes, that appears to be correct.

This appears to be correct.
