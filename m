My expectation is that all users would have called
get_cpu_fpsimd_context().

The reason for writing the check that way is that we can't meaningfully
inspect percpu variables unless we are non-preemptible already.  The &&
means we don't do the percpu read at all is the case where preemptible()
is true.

Or do you think my logic is wrong somewhere?  (It's possible...)
