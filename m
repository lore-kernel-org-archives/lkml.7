I am sorry but I am not really convinced by the above reasoning wrt. to
the allocator API and it has been a subject of many changes over time. I
do not remember a single case where we would be bending the allocator
API because of external modules and I am pretty sure we will push back
heavily if that was the case in the future.

So in this particular case I would go with consistency and export the
same way we do with other functions. Also we do not want people to
reinvent this API and screw that like we have seen in other cases when
external modules try reimplement core functionality themselves.

Thanks!
