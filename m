This is (sadly) a fix; we access invalid memory or leak kernel memory to
userspace if we access the monitor sysfs files when there are no monitor
pages allocated.

Indeed, but I've had it in my queue for a few weeks now so it's been
receiving a good amount of testing - it's not something we came up with
a few days ago.

I would prefer if you could take it in. While it's on the bigger side, a
lot of it is documentation (and comments!), and the code itself is
straightforward and was well reviewed over 6 iterations of the original
