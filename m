I don't see the benefit in attempting to maintain compatibility with
existing tooling unless you're going to be *completely* compatible
with existing tooling. That means supporting dbx and dbt.

Ok. I think that's realistically fine.

So I do the following:

1) Boot
2) Extend the contents of db
3) Extend the contents of db again
4) Read back the contents of db through efivarfs
5) Reboot
6) Read back the contents of db through efivarfs

Is what I see in (4) and (6) the same? Does it contain the values form
both extensions?

Why would the intermediate level organisations not just have entries
in db? The main reason we don't do it this way in UEFI is because we
need to support dbx, and if you're not supporting dbx I'm not sure I
see the benefit.
