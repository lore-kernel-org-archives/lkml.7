Hi Federico,

I wish I could point you to a complete solution, but there is a lot of
work to be done in this area.  Most of what is in the kernel is a low
level in-kernel API [4].  As you correctly state, the hardest part of
this is doing the enumerating if you are on x86 and aren't using
devicetree.

I have heard it suggested that we work on using DT overlays on x86*.
It's clear there's work to be done to make that work.  I don't know if
anybody has really tried.  It seems impractical to map or translate a
x86 systems ACPI into a DT and go from there.  One suggestion a few
years ago was adding a partial DT that had nodes that could serve as
overlay targets and have that running in parallel with ACPI.

There's one other interface in the kernel upstream. The DFL (device
feature list) framework built on the FPGA manager/bridge/region stuff
[5].   It's probably not what you specifically are looking for, I'm
mentioning as it exists in upstream.  It has a limited type of
enumeration and appears to mostly be geared for acceleration rather
than adding and enumerating any random hardware block.  Also it
requires specific bitstreams as the feature list is in fpga fabric.
