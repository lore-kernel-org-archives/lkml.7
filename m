The copyright line doesn't work quite the way it should in the rendered HTML.

It seems to me it should be:

:Copyright: 2003, 2008 Intel Corporation

Tom has used an ambiguous date format; given it appeared in the tree
in December 2003, I suspect he's used middle-endian format.  It doesn't
really seem relevant to have the dates here any more, so we could skip
including them.  Also, none of these email addresses work, so perhaps
just drop those too.

:Authors: Tom L Nguyen; Martine Silbermann; Matthew Wilcox

Should we drop the numbering of sections as part of this conversion?
I'd be inclined to.

This should really be turned into kernel-doc and moved to pci.h, but
that seems like an awfully large amount of work to ask you to do when
you're already doing so much to improve the situation.

This is also a really bad document.  It has three audiences; people
configuring their kernel, people writing device drivers and people trying
to debug why their kernel doesn't work.  Again, that's not on you to
fix, but it's pretty frustrating to see so much good information so
badly organised.
