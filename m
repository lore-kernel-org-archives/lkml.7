Subject: [PATCH 0/3] tools lib traceevent: Fixing the API to be less policy driven
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Arnaldo and Jiri,

We are still working on getting libtraceevent ready to be a stand alone
library. Part of that is to audit all the interfaces. We noticed
that the most the tep_print_*() interfaces define policy and limit
the way an application can display data. Instead of fixing this later
and being stuck with a limiting API that we must maintain for backward
compatibility, we removed and replaced most of it. perf was only affected
by a single function that was removed. These functions are replaced
by a more flexible one that allows the user to place what they want
where they want it (timestamps, event info, latency format, COMM, PID, etc).

The other noticeable perf change, is that we changed the location to
where the plugins are loaded from:

 ${HOME}/.traceevent/plugins

to

 ${HOME}/.local/lib/traceevent/plugins

As Patrick McLean (Gentoo package maintainer) informed us of the
XGD layout.

Should we have something the warns people if they have plugins in
the old directory. Should we move them on install? Currently, we
just ignore them.

Anyway, please add these patches to tip.

Thanks!
