Each time you read that reset internal counters to 0.

I don't know, the datasheet don't describe the role of each bit in 
registers and I don't found documentation which provide that. I had to 
do research on example code to retrieve some bits, but got nothing on 
motion detection pin configuration.

Ok, I decided to return delta between last read/buffering to stay closer 
to the hardware mechanism and still coherent with "IIO_CHAN_INFO_RAW". 
If user want absolute position, he can make an addition of all received 
value in user space, and that allow him to reset/replace the initial 
position when he want it.
