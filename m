No. I think it improves robustness and correctness.

I would be interested to know whether there is any measurable performance 
impact on zorro_esp.

I'm not entirely sure that the chip is unaffected by stale counter values. 

(Stale transfer counter values are distinct from stale transfer count 
register values. Both are addressed by the patch.)

If there are DMA controllers out there that can't do very short transfers 
then this objection would seem to be invalid, because the "DMA length is 
zero!" issue could be tackled using PIO.

Aren't you overlooking all of the ESP_CMD_DMA flags in the core driver?

Thanks for your review.
