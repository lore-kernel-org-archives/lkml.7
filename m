Sigh.  You are right.

I thought I had checked for that when I made my change there.  But
do_bad_area will definitely do that, and that was one of the cases that
jumped out at me as needing to be fixed, when I skimmed the arm code.

I will respin this patch to move that lower.

I would not mind but as long as we aren't misusing the generic bits
I won't have alarm bells going of in my head when I look at their
users.
