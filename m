Heh.
I do not know why you are so confident with your code, though.

OK, let's say this script has no bug.

But, the script may fail for a different reason.
For example, what if cpio is not installed on the user's machine.

In such a situation, this script will produce empty
kernel/kheaders_data.tar.xz, but the build system
will continue running, and succeed.

Don't you think it will better to let the build immediately fail
than letting the user debug a wrongly created image ?

I tested my code, and it worked for me.

perl -e <command_line>

is useful to run short code directly.

I do not know why you say it does not work.
