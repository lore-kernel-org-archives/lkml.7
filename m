I'll leave it for the RT folks to comment on this.  (I see Sebastian
already did.)

Ah yes, I missed that.

We don't need all this logic in the !CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON case of
course, but I'm not sure it's worth optimising that special case.
Especially so if we don't see any significant impact in ctxsw-heavy
benchmarks.

Probably not worth it for now.

Hmmm, looks like I got my reply out of order here.

I meant the helper (if any) to check
!preemptible() && !__this_cpu_read(kernel_neon_busy).

Looks like you inferred what I meant later on anyway.

Yes, or even better, name the function used to do this (i.e.,
kernel_neon_disable() or get_cpu_fpsimd_context() or whatever it's
called).

Yes, just confirming my understanding here.

Thanks.  You can repost the patch before this is done though,
to help move the review forward.
