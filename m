I believe that would be the conclusion of a dispassionate observer who
has followed this conversation and read the paper that I provided a
link to.

For the benefit of those with a disinclination to read, particularly
16 page research papers, the following link provides a summary of the
issues at hand.

https://www.securityweek.com/intel-sgx-can-be-abused-hide-advanced-malware-researchers

Of relevance to this conversation is Intel Security's official
response to the paper, which is as follows:

"The value of Intel SGX is to execute code in a protected enclave;
however, Intel SGX does not guarantee that the code executed in the
enclave is from a trusted source.  In all cases, we recommend
utilizing programs, files, apps and plugins from trusted sources,"
Intel said.

The issue is not as much the ABI break but the following facts that
are at hand:

1.) The proposed mainline driver offers no cryptographic or
architecturally relevant security controls for ensuring that enclaves
are from a trusted source.

2.) Based on Andy's comments there may be a disinclination to ever
provide those controls.

3.) The approach we propose addresses these issues while imposing no
functional limitations on how Linux platform owners can use enclave
technology.

Seems like a win.

There you go, one sentence replies.
