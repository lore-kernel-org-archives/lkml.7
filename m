Hi Claudio,

Thanks for posting this.

I am *very* reluctant to start selecting CONFIG_EFI on powerpc.

Simply because we don't actually have EFI, and I worry we're going to
both break assumptions in the EFI code as well as impose requirements on
the powerpc code that aren't really necessary.

So I'd definitely prefer we go the route of enabling efivarfs with an
alternate backend.

Better still would be a generic secure variable interface as Matt
suggests, if the userspace tools can be relatively easily adapted to use
that interface.

cheers
