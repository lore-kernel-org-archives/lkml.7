My plan is to describe the problem first for the public in the room. Then 
describe the proposals and their advantages and disadvantages. This should 
start the discussion pretty well.

I would be happy if we managed to settle at least on the requirements for 
a solution. It seems that our experience with users and their use cases 
differ a lot and I doubt we could come up with a good solution without 
stating what we want (and don't want) first.

Silly hope is that there may be someone with a perfect solution in the 
room. After all, it is what conferences are for.

Maybe.
