First time I hear about this, thanks for the heads up.

We did look at converting the s390 gup code to CONFIG_HAVE_GENERIC_GUP,
there are some details that need careful consideration. The top one
is access_ok(), for s390 we always return true. The generic gup code
relies on the fact that a page table walk with a specific address is
doable if access_ok() returned true, the s390 specific check is slightly
different:

        if ((end <= start) || (end > mm->context.asce_limit))
                return 0;

The obvious approach would be to modify access_ok() to check against
the asce_limit. I will try and see if anything breaks, e.g. the automatic
page table upgrade.

On s390 we can have up to 16TB of memory in a single LPAR. So yes, I do
care about it.
