This would look better on both text and html if you format it as:

       - PCI_ERS_RESULT_CAN_RECOVER:
                  Driver returns this if it thinks it might be able to recover
                  the HW by just banging IOs or if it wants to be given
                  a chance to extract some diagnostic information (see
                  mmio_enable, below).
       - PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET:
                  Driver returns this if it can't recover without a
                  slot reset.
       - PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT:
                  Driver returns this if it doesn't want to recover at all.

It sounds you forgot to reformat the note with ">>>", e. g.
something like:

.. note::

    The current powerpc implementation assumes that a device driver will
    *not* schedule or semaphore in this routine; the current powerpc
    implementation uses one kernel thread to notify all devices;
    thus, if one device sleeps/schedules, all devices are affected.
    Doing better requires complex multi-threaded logic in the error
    recovery implementation (e.g. waiting for all notification threads
    to "join" before proceeding with recovery.)  This seems excessively
    complex and not worth implementing.

    The current powerpc implementation doesn't much care if the device
    attempts I/O at this point, or not.  I/O's will fail, returning
    a value of 0xff on read, and writes will be dropped. If more than
    EEH_MAX_FAILS I/O's are attempted to a frozen adapter, EEH
    assumes that the device driver has gone into an infinite loop
    and prints an error to syslog.  A reboot is then required to
    get the device working again.

Same as above, this would look a way better if you format it as:

	- PCI_ERS_RESULT_RECOVERED
		  Driver returns this if it thinks the device is fully
		  functional and thinks it is ready to start
		  normal driver operations again. There is no
		  guarantee that the driver will actually be
		  allowed to proceed, as another driver on the
		  same segment might have failed and thus triggered a
		  slot reset on platforms that support it.

	- PCI_ERS_RESULT_NEED_RESET
		  Driver returns this if it thinks the device is not
		  recoverable in its current state and it needs a slot
		  reset to proceed.

	- PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT
		  Same as above. Total failure, no recovery even after
		  reset driver dead. (To be defined more precisely)

Again, you forgot to convert one note there, just after the above
lines:

.. note::

    The current powerpc implementation does not try a power-cycle
    reset if the driver returned PCI_ERS_RESULT_DISCONNECT.
    However, it probably should.

Another note to be converted:

.. note::

    Implementation details for the powerpc platform are discussed in
    the file Documentation/powerpc/eeh-pci-error-recovery.txt  

    As of this writing, there is a growing list of device drivers with
    patches implementing error recovery. Not all of these patches are in
    mainline yet. These may be used as "examples"::

      drivers/scsi/ipr
      drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2
...
