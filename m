That's not currently feasible when cc'ing any vger.kernel.org list
as those lists have a maximum email header size and patches that
span multiple subsystems can have very long to: and cc: lists.

That's rather too compiler version dependent and new
warnings frequently get introduced by new compiler versions.

Adding a sparse clean C=2 requirement might be useful.

I believe the "why" is rather more important than the "how"
and should be the primary thing described in the commit message.
