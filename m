On laptops, 0.5 W can result in noticeably longer battery life.

Is dmesg spammed even if no driver is bound to a GPU?  If so, that would
suggest a solution that's not dependent on drivers.  E.g., the
bw_notification port service could avoid reports for devices matching
PCI_BASE_CLASS_DISPLAY.  (It could also avoid binding to ports whose
children include such a device, but the child may be hot-pluggable
and thus appear only after the port is bound.)  Then we'd still get
a notification on boot about degraded link speed, but not continuous
messages.

Thanks,

Lukas
