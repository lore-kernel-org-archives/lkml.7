No it does not but I would like to understand how relevant is fixing
those drivers (that should not use ISA IO space without first claiming
their resources, for the records) given that PPC did not even try and
apparently that's not a problem.

I do not have the full picture but I suspect that, apart from x86/IA64,
this is a common issue across architectures, I am trying to untangle
how ARM 32-bit deals with this (if it does).
