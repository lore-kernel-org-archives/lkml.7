Hmm... you didn't touch on this part of the document:

	And what ACPI video driver does is:
	actual_brightness: on read, control method _BQC will be evaluated to
	get the brightness level the firmware thinks it is at;
	bl_power: not implemented, will set the current brightness instead;
	brightness: on write, control method _BCM will run to set the requested
	brightness level;
	max_brightness: Derived from the _BCL package(see below);
	type: firmware

You should touch it. My suggestion here is:

Perhaps making this as a table would work better:

    input device it created:

	=====		===================
	event		keycode
	=====		===================
	0x86		KEY_BRIGHTNESSUP
	0x87		KEY_BRIGHTNESSDOWN
