I'm glad you figured that out yourself. Was about to write up something to
that effect.

Still interesting questions remain:

  1) How did you end up feeding an unaligned address into that which points
     to a 0 PUD?

  2) Is this related to Facebook specific changes and unlikely to affect any
     regular kernel? I can't come up with a way to trigger that in mainline

  3) As this is a user page table and the missing mapping is related to
     mappings required by PTI, how is the machine going in/out of user
     space in the first place? Or did I just trip over what you called
     nonsense?

Thanks,
