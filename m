Hi Logan,

Sorry for the delay.  This code gives a headache.  I still remember
my headache from the last time we touched it.  Help me understand
what's going on here.

I guess the bug is that some BAR or window is unset when we actually
have space for it?  We need to make this more concrete, e.g., with a
minimal example of a failure case, and then connect this code change
specifically with that.

"Ignored BARs" doesn't seem like the best terminology here.  Can we
just say they're "unset" as you do for windows?  Even that's a little
squishy because there's really no such thing as a clearly "unset" or
invalid value for a BAR.  All we can say is that Linux *thinks* it's
unset because it happens to be zero (technically still a valid BAR
value) or it conflicts with another device.

Strictly speaking, the result is that we can't enable decoding for
that BAR type.  Often that does mean the device is unusable, but in
some cases, e.g., an I/O BAR being unset and a driver using
pci_enable_device_mem(), the device *is* usable.

Surely realloc can fail even without a large 64-bit BAR?  I don't
think there's a magic threshold at 1GB.  Maybe an example would
illustrate the problem better.

There are actually three calls to pbus_size_mem():

  1) If bridge has a 64-bit prefetchable window, find the size of all
     64-bit prefetchable resources below the bridge

  2) If bridge has no 64-bit prefetchable window, find the size of all
     prefetchable resources below the bridge

  3) Find the size of everything else (non-prefetchable resources plus
     any prefetchable ones that couldn't be accommodated above)

Sorry again for being so literal and unimaginative, but I don't
understand how the code "expects the size of the ... window to be
multiple GBs which will never be assignable ...".  Whether things are
assignable just depends on what resources are available.  It's not a
matter of "expecting" the window to be big enough; it just is big
enough or it isn't.

I guess this question of putting a 64-bit resource in the 32-bit
non-prefetchable window (legal but undesirable) is a secondary thing,
not the chief complaint you're fixing?
