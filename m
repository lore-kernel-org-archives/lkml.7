Hi Dave,

Thank you for the review.

Based on the discussion in this thread, migrate_enable/migrate_disable 
is not suitable in this context.

The goal of those helpers is to pin the task to the current CPU. On RT, 
it will not disable the preemption. So the current task can be preempted 
by a task with higher priority.

The next task may require to use the FPSIMD and will potentially result 
to corrupt the state.

RT folks already saw this corruption because local_bh_disable() does not 
preempt on RT. They are carrying a patch (see "arm64: fpsimd: use 
preemp_disable in addition to local_bh_disable()") to disable preemption 
along with local_bh_disable().

Alternatively, Julia suggested to introduce a per-cpu lock to protect 
the state. I am thinking to defer this for a follow-up patch. The 
changes in this patch should make it easier because we now have helper 
to mark the critical section.

kernel_neon_busy will be used in fpsimd.c even when with 
!CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON. So it makes sense to also declare it in the 
header even if not used.

Another solution is to avoid expose kernel_neon_busy outside of fpsimd.c 
and use an helper.

I am not sure where you suggested a checking helper above. Do you refer 
to exposing kernel_neon_busy even for !CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON?

How about not mentioning preemption at all and just say:

"The fpsimd context should be acquired before hand".

This would help if we ever decide to protect critical section differently.

With what I said above, we could replace this check 
WARN_ON(!have_cpu_fpsimd_context()).

I think so.

I already fixed it in my tree. Thank you for the reminder.

I will have a look.

I will see what I can do.

I will give a try with hackbench/kernbench.
