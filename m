There is (non-PCI) HW that does that. On EOI, they force the interrupt
controller to resample the level, which results in a new edge to be
generated if the level is high. This of course require some HW, usually
a register taking the ID of the line that needs resampling. I'd be
surprised if there wasn't something along those lines in your HW, at
least as a debug mechanism.

OK.
