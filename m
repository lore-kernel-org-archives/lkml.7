Ah, I meant that those are pci devices.

That does seem like an extra burden for the user: IIUC, things work
even if you have too many queues, it's just not optimal. It sounds like
something that can be done by a management layer (e.g. libvirt), though.

That sounds better, as both transports and drivers can opt-in here.

However, maybe it would be even better to try to come up with a better
strategy of allocating msix vectors in virtio-pci. More vectors in the
num_queues > num_cpus case, even if they still need to be shared?
Individual vectors for n-1 cpus and then a shared one for the remaining
queues?

It might even be device-specific: Have some low-traffic status queues
share a vector, and provide an individual vector for high-traffic
queues. Would need some device<->transport interface, obviously.
