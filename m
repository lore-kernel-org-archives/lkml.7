Subject: [PATCH-tip v2 05/12] locking/rwsem: Ensure an RT task will not spin on reader

An RT task can do optimistic spinning only if the lock holder is
actually running. If the state of the lock holder isn't known, there
is a possibility that high priority of the RT task may block forward
progress of the lock holder if it happens to reside on the same CPU.
This will lead to deadlock. So we have to make sure that an RT task
will not spin on a reader-owned rwsem.

When the owner is temporarily set to NULL, it is more tricky to decide
if an RT task should stop spinning as it may be a temporary state
where another writer may have just stolen the lock which then failed
the task's trylock attempt. So one more retry is allowed to make sure
that the lock is not spinnable by an RT task.

When testing on a 8-socket IvyBridge-EX system, the one additional retry
seems to improve locking performance of RT write locking threads under
heavy contentions. The table below shows the locking rates (in kops/s)
with various write locking threads before and after the patch.
