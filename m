Indeed.

That might be true for the current two cases that operate on a temporary
local list, but in general we have lots of cases where we operate on
lists that are not just local and where have to delete all the entries.

Sure, we could somehow let them dangle and then just do a INIT_LIST_HEAD
on the list later, but that is just asking for trouble down the road
when people actually use list_empty in the functions called in the loop.
