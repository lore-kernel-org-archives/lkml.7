I disagree with the idea of doing something you know can cause an error 
to propagate. That being said, in this particular case we have come to 
rely a little too much on the if (disconnected) model.

You mentioned in the other thread that fixing the GHES driver will pay 
much higher dividends. I'm working on reviving a couple of changes to do 
just that. Some industry folk were very concerned about the "don't 
panic()" approach, and I want to make sure I fairly present their 
arguments in the cover letter.

I'm hoping one day we'll have the ability to use page tables to prevent 
the situations that we're trying to fix today in less than ideal ways. 
Although there are other places in msi.c that use if (disconnected), I'm 
okay with dropping this change -- provided we come up with an equivalent 
fix.

But even if FFS doesn't crash, do we really want to lose hundreds of 
milliseconds to SMM --on all cores-- when all it takes is a couple of 
cycles to check a flag?
