Thanks for the hybrid tutorial (snipped from this response).  IIUC,
what you said was that in hybrid mode, the Intel GPU drives the
built-in display and the Nvidia GPU drives any external displays and
may be used for DRI PRIME rendering (whatever that is).  But since you
say the Nvidia device gets runtime suspended, I assume there's no
external display here and you're not using DRI PRIME.

I wonder if it's related to the fact that the Nvidia GPU has been
runtime suspended before you do the reboot.  Can you try turning of
runtime power management for the GPU by setting the runpm module
parameter to 0?  I *think* this would be booting with
"nouveau.runpm=0".

Can you please make a bugzilla.kernel.org entry with as much
information (dmesg, "lspci -vvxxx", dmidecode, etc) as you can get
approval for?  You can include the Red Hat bugzilla URL in the commit
log, too, but that's not quite as good because we have no control over
whether it's public.

Sounds like Lenovo is going to a lot of trouble for this.  The ideal
thing from my point of view would be if they could figure out why this
works on Windows but not on Linux.  I doubt Windows has a quirk like
this, so if we could figure out why it works on Windows, we could
likely do something similar in Linux.
