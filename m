How do you know the difference between long if you are running on a
64bit kernel in 32bit userspace? I haven't compiled into ebpf byte
code, so I'm clueless here, but I know other tools (PowerTop) got burnt
when it assumed "long" was 4 bytes when digging into the kernel via
trace events, when the kernel was 64bit and user was 32bit.

I don't care about user space here. I'm talking about the tools that
need to dig into the kernel, but the tools are 32bit and the kernel is
64bit. Of course, if the tools know the kernel is 64bit regardless,
then it doesn't matter.

We already embed dwarf like information in the kernel. It's called ORC,
and is used by bpf (as well as perf, ftrace and stack dumps) when we
need to read functions. A very small subset of dwarf like data would be
used. Just the data structures, nothing else.
