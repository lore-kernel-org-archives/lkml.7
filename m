I suppose imp-def algorithm should not make any difference in migration 
case even if the 2 system uses different imp-def algorithm. As the LR 
PAC field generation happens at runtime so only things matters is key 
value and SP which is taken care. Also the model on which I am testing 
uses imp-def algorithm. Or am I missing something ?

Yes you are right and looks like this is a missed patch of commit 
aa6eece8ec5095e479. I suppose this can be posted as a separate patch.

Yes most of the ptrauth instructions are treated as NOP but some 
instructions like PACGA and XPAC [0] are always enabled and may trap if 
CONFIG_ARM64_PTR_AUTH is disabled. In VHE mode this is not trapping as 
HCR_EL2.TGE is set. But in NVHE mode this is causing hang instead of 
trap if tested with HCR_EL2.API=0. Further checking on it.

Yes using a callee register is an option.

ok __noptrauth annotation may be better as some functions are already
