This is hard to tell. I haven't seen any "Error sending SCAN_CFG_CMD:"
message in the kernel log yet and I believe this is related to the
crash. But I might be easily wrong here.

In any case, I suspect that those events usually happen in a different
wireless environment than I am running right now. So give me some more
time before I can be more confident with an answer.
