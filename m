Hi Alexandre,

So I have no problem with this as an IIO driver, but for devices that
are somewhat 'on the edge' I always like to get a clear answer to the
question: Why not input?

I would also argue that, to actually be 'useful' we would typically need
some representation of the 'mechanicals' that are providing the motion
being measured.  Looking at the datasheet this includes, rotating shafts
(side or end on), disk edges and flat surface tracking (mouse like).

That's easy enough to do with the iio in kernel consumer interface. These
are similar to when we handle analog electronic front ends.

I you can, please describe what it is being used for in your application
as that may give us somewhere to start!

So arguably this is actually measuring differential position, or sort of
'velocity'.  I think it should probably be mapped to simple position though=
.  See

These defines actually mostly add to obscure what is going on.
In my mind, the values themselves are clearer than the defines.

I think client is only used to get dev for debug message purposes.
you can get that in a number of other ways including from the regmap.

Hence drop client from this structure.

That is not how mod_x_and_y is used.  It only exists for events, not
to let you define your own version of channels with two elements.

In IIO these are two separate channels and must be represented as
such.

There is another problem here, in what type of channel this actually
is.  Now I may have the following wrong as the datasheet is less than
super clear!.

It's not outputting position at all, but rather a delta value from
when it was either:
1. last read? (not sure on this)
2. last fired an interrupt?
3. last took a sample? (fixed sampling frequency).=20

If 1 or 2, I would suggest that you provide absolute position to
Linux.  So add the value to a software counter and provide that.
32 bits should be plenty of resolution for that.

If 3, it's a velocity sensor so report it as velocity not position.

If it is actually not possible to report the two channels separately
then don't report them at all except via the buffered interface and
set the available scan masks so that both are on.

Why?  This is reading a value, if there is no motion, then is the
right answer not to set it to such? i.e. 0.

Also we carefully used a macro to hide the fact it is bit7 so don't put
it in the comment ;)

One thing that isn't clear from the datasheet I am looking at is whether th=

This looks like sign extension to me.  We have standard functions for
that.sign_extend32.  Note that it's actually cheaper to do a 32 bit sign ex=
tend
to 32 bits than it is to 16, then assign back to 16 if you want to.

That's not how the IIO interface works.  You can't just push values
into different fields.  These are two axis, and are independent.
If you absolutely have to read them together then it must be done with
the buffered interface and we simply don't provide a read raw interface at
all.

Silly question for you.  What happens if you set the delta values to 0?
Do we get an interrupt which is effectively data ready?
If we do, you might want to think about a scheme where that is an option.
As things currently stand we have a confusing interface where changing this
threshold effects the buffered data output.   That should only be the
case if this interface is for a trigger, not an event.

Why on the stack?  It's small and last thing you want to
do is a memory allocation ever time.

Also, you haven't allowed for the required alignment of the
timestamp. This needs to be a multiple of 8 bytes.

Make payload and array of u16 and you can just assign directly.

Hmm. This is not how IIO is normally used.  So the oddity here is the sensor
only produces an interrupt on a change of value.

So in IIO terms this would normally be considered a 'value change trigger'
driving normal buffered sampling.  I think it is also perfectly valid
if someone wants evenly spaced samples to read on demand?  If so
then you definitely want to allow use of high resolution timer triggers
and similar.=20

So, create a trigger that is base don the 'event' - there are other drivers
doing this.  It's possible that you might want that 'trigger' to also
call the iio event interface, but usually only if there are usecases where
knowing "motion happened" is useful rather than what the motion was.

Then use the triggered_buffer helpers to set up all the data capture side
of things.

That one is wrong btw, surely it is IIO_MOD_X_OR_Y. You aren't
triggering on motion in 'both X and Y' directions, motion in one
of them is enough.

Hmm. Direct use of kfifo's is fairly unusual as it normally means there
is something unusual about how the device is being mapped to the IIO
elements.

I'd rename this, its a fifo, rather than a ring (it was a ring
early in IIO's history so the naming still kicks around
in a few drivers).

This is wrapped onto more lines than necessary.  Kernel coding convention
is to keep as many parameters on each line as fit under 80 chars.

Multiline, comment style in most of the kernel, including IIO is

Don't add comments for things that are obvious from the code.
(i.e. the sleep above and this one).

Need to control this from somewhere. Device tree binding perhaps?

This just makes the code flow harder to follow.  If you want to add
the print out, just replicate it, with information for example on=20
which register access failed.

Only do goto, return paths if there is actual code to run.

Clean up this blank line.
