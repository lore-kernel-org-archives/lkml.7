Once upon a time, I used it to run Matlab.

It works for many applications, though I did have to add a few syscalls
myself (yes, I sent patches).

That's interesting, but it doesn't mean nobody is using it.  I tend to
run the LTS branches and switch to a new one only once it seems to have
settled a bit, so when 4.16 was released, I was probably still running
4.9.  I don't think I'm the only one using this strategy.
