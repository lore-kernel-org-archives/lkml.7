Why? Please preserve as much as possible from the original file...
it is really hard to see what you're doing. Most of those x86
files are already almost at ReST format (like this one). There's
absolutely **no reason** why you would do so much radical changes
that would below the 50% similarity threshold that would make git
to recognize as a change on the same file!

I'll give a quick review on this one, but it is really hard to be
sure that something is missing, when the similarity is too low.

I would just place the :: on the above line. Same applies to similar
cases on this file.

Something got broken here.

And here... This one, for example, should be, instead:

        [package 0] -> [core 0] -> [thread 0] -> Linux CPU 0
                                -> [thread 1] -> Linux CPU 1
                    -> [core 1] -> [thread 0] -> Linux CPU 2
                                -> [thread 1] -> Linux CPU 3

Clearly there's something that it is messing with tabs on your
x86 conversion.

I'll stop my review here, as it sounds pointless to review it,
as there are too many broken whitespace stuff on your
conversion.

Thanks,
Mauro
