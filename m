For now we can add host->ops as update_dcmd_desc and pass the task_desc 
of DCMD for updating any params which host may want to update.

Sure, for now the requirement has come up only for DCMD desc update. 
Sure we can add task descriptor ops in the similar way later when required.

Adrian, please confirm if you are fine with both of above?
