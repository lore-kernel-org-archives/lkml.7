I gave up, especially after the snark from Linus
where he wrote I don't understand this stuff.

He's just too full of himself here merely using
argument from authority.

Creating and using a function like copy_string with
both source and destination lengths specified is
is also potentially a large source of defects where
the stracpy macro atop strscpy does not have a
defect path other than the src not being a string
at all.

I think the analysis of defects in string function
in the kernel is overly difficult today given the
number of possible uses of pointer and length in
strcpy/strncpy/strlcpy/stracpy.

I think also that there is some sense in what he
wrote against the "word salad" use of str<foo>cpy,
but using stracpy as a macro when possible instead
of strscpy also makes the analysis of defects rather
simpler.

The trivial script cocci I posted works well for the
simple cases.

https://lore.kernel.org/cocci/66fcdbf607d7d0bea41edb39e5579d63b62b7d84.camel@perches.com/

The more complicated cocci script Julia posted is
still not quite correct as it required intermediate
compilation for verification of specified lengths.

Tell me again if you still want it and maybe the
couple conversions that mm/ would get.
