As do we.

The point we have been making is that depending on the LSM's are
depending on the fact that the platform has not been compromised.  SGX
is designed to provide a trusted execution environment in the face of
a compromised platform.

I believe current research suggests that this is not the case.

From the paper we have previously cited:

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.08719.pdf

In the second paragraph of the abstract:

"In this paper, we demonstrate fine-grained software-based
side-channel attacks from a malicious SGX enclave targeting co-located
enclaves.  Our attack is the first malware running on real SGX
hardware, abusing SGX protection features to conceal itself.
Furthermore, we demonstrate our attack both in a native environment
and across multiple Docker containers".

To be perfectly clear, Dr. Greg, technically IDfusion, is not
proposing the use of SGX's launch control to restrict which enclaves
can run, although there are perfectly legitimate and required use
cases for that technology.

Dr. Greg is proposing that the kernel driver expend 1.2 pages of
kernel memory to implement, at the discretion of the platform owner,
cryptographically verified enclave initialization.  The design we
proposed is the strongest guarantee that a platform owner can
implement, on FLC hardware, that only code and data of known
provenance can be loaded and executed.

There are only two companies that have written the entire stack of
software needed to make practical SGX applications work, us and Intel.
We can go into intimate detail on the issues involved but will embrace
bevity at this point.

Have a good day.

Dr. Greg
