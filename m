Hello Gautham,

Thanks for your review.

Inded, very good point. I added this information to the patch
description.

Ah, thanks for pointing this out. That was a scenario I thought could
happen when I was investigating this issue but I never confirmed whether
it could really happen. I removed it from the patch description.

That's very good to know. I added this information to the patch
description.

I also added you in an Analyzed-by tag, I hope it's fine with you.

Good idea. I increased the loop to 200 iterations so that it can take up
to 20 ms, just to be sure.
