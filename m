Okay.  You could try skipping that pci_write_config_byte() call.  The 
following loop would probably time out, and you might find that the 
code crashes later on.

You could also try setting try_handoff to 0 near the start of the
routine.  Your system plus the Comtrol PCI card could have the same
sort of bug as reported in Bugzilla #77021.
