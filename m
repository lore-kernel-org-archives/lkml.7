I'll have to look at your patches more closely, but I think it should
be possible to generate the command string synth_event_run_command()
needs, or the equivalent const char *args[] array you mentioned, from
the higher-level event definition in my patches.

So the two ways of defining an event in my patches is 1) from a static
array known at build-time defined like this:

  static struct synth_field_desc synthtest_fields[] = {
       { .type = "pid_t",              .name = "next_pid_field" },
       { .type = "char[16]",           .name = "next_comm_field" },
       { .type = "u64",                .name = "ts_ns" },
       { .type = "u64",                .name = "ts_ms" },
       { .type = "unsigned int",       .name = "cpu" },
       { .type = "char[64]",           .name = "my_string_field" },
       { .type = "int",                .name = "my_int_field" },
  };

which is then passed to create_synth_event(&synthtest_fields)

or 2) at run-time by adding fields individually as they become known:

  add_synth_field("type", "name")

which requires some sort of start/end("event name").

I think that should all be possible using your patches, and maybe
generalizable to not just synth events by removing _synth_ from
everything?  Let me know what you think.  If that's correct, I can go
and rewrite the event creation part on top of your patches.

I did notice that I said that trace_types_lock and event_mutex should
be held for trace_array_find() but it should only be trace_types_lock,
and then I missed doing that in get_event_file() in one place.  And I
also don't really need the nolock versions, so will simplify and remove
them.  I think elsewhere event_mutex is taken where needed.  But if
talking about something else, please let me know.

Thanks,

Tom
