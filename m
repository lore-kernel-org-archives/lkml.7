I have already been down that road. In the Android ecosystem, the Android
teams only provide a "userspace system image" which goes on the system
partition of the flash (and a couple other images are also provided but
system is the main one). The system image cannot contain GPL source code. It
is also not possible to put kernel headers for every kernel version on the
system images that ship and is not practical. Android boots on 1000s of forked
kernels. It does not make sense to provide headers on the system image for
every kernel version and I already had many discussions on the subject with
the teams, it is something that is just not done. Now for kernel modules,
there's another image called the "vendor image" which is flashed onto the
vendor parition, this is where kernel modules go.  This vendor image is not
provided by Google for non-Pixel devices. So we have no control over what
goes there BUT we do know that kernel modules that are enabled will go there,
and we do have control over enforcing that certain kernel modules should be
built and available as they are mandatory for Android to function properly.
We would also possibly make it a built-in option as well. Anyway my point is
keeping it in the kernel is really the easiest and the smartest choice IMO.

Yes, that's true. Check the other thread with Masahiro that we are discussing
this point on and let us continue discussing there:

I felt using a compressed tar is really the easiest way because of all the
tools are already available. There isn't a compressed in-ram filesystem right
now that I'm aware off that can achieve the kind of high compression ratio
this patchset does.
