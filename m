This isn't a Tegra194 question; it's a question of whether this
behavior is covered by the PCIe spec.

It makes sense that you should call pci_stop_root_bus() during
.remove(), i.e., when the host controller driver is being removed,
because the PCI bus will no longer be accessible.  I think you should
call it *directly* from tegra_pcie_dw_remove() because that will match
what other drivers do.

I don't understand this part.  We should be able to runtime suspend
the host controller without detaching drivers for child devices.

If you shutdown the controller completely and detach the *host
controller driver*, sure, it makes sense to detach drivers from child
devices.  But that would be handled by the host controller .remove()
method, not by the runtime suspend method.
