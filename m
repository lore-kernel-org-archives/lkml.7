Thank you for the explanation.

I am not entirely familiar with printk, so I may have overlooked something.

Looking at the printk code (see vprintk_emit), the message will be loaded in the 
log buffer. The log buffer will be printed out by klogd if vprintk_emit were 
called from a context where IRQs or preemption is disabled.

So I think the printk should still happen from atomic context but it will get 
delayed until we are out from the atomic context.

Cheers,
