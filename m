== Changes since v7 ==

  Fixed an early return that prevented reporting HMAT when there are no
  direct attached initiators.

  Fixed introducing a variable that was unused until several patches
  later.

  Miscellaneous typos, editorial clarifications, and whitespace fixups.

  Merged to most current linux-next.

  Added received review, test, and ack by's.

I've published a git tree available on this branch:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/kbusch/linux.git/log/?h=hmat-v8

== Background ==

Platforms may provide multiple types of cpu attached system memory. The
memory ranges for each type may have different characteristics that
applications may wish to know about when considering what node they want
their memory allocated from.

It had previously been difficult to describe these setups as memory
rangers were generally lumped into the NUMA node of the CPUs. New
platform attributes have been created and in use today that describe
the more complex memory hierarchies that can be created.

This series' objective is to provide the attributes from such systems
that are useful for applications to know about, and readily usable with
existing tools and libraries. Those applications may query performance
attributes relative to a particular CPU they're running on in order to
make more informed choices for where they want to allocate hot and cold
data. This works with mbind() or the numactl library.

  acpi/hmat: Parse and report heterogeneous memory
  node: Link memory nodes to their compute nodes
  node: Add heterogenous memory access attributes
  node: Add memory-side caching attributes
  acpi/hmat: Register processor domain to its memory
  acpi/hmat: Register performance attributes
  acpi/hmat: Register memory side cache attributes
  doc/mm: New documentation for memory performance
