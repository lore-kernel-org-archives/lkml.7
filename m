Ok, I was able to hit this bug with QEMU and I found out a bunch of
minutiae about this bug.

For starters pci=realloc is not really what I (or others) had expected:
it really just tries *harder* to re-assign any resources the bios failed
to assign. So really all this mess in setup-bus is strictly there to
work around bios issues. I was also expecting it to be able to insert
gaps for hotplug with the hpmemsize parameter, but if the bios assigns
all the devices correctly, adding parameters such as
pci=realloc,hpmemsize=8M" will actually do nothing, on x86 at least.

So to hit this bug in real life the bios has to fail to assign a large
64-bit BAR as well as somehow have 32-bit non-prefetchable resources
need to be re-allocated (possibly as a result of other failed
assignments). So I suspect on the system we hit this bug on, the bios
failed to allocate a bunch of resources, which pci=realloc was *mostly*
able to fix up; but this bug caused it to "ignore" a bunch of unrelated
resources.

As QEMU does not have a broken bios, and always seems to do sensible
things, reproducing the bug is a bit difficult. To hit the bug, I had to
apply the hack patch given at the end of the email to release a large
BAR as well as the 32-bit non-prefetchable memory for the entire bus
before executing the rest of the code in
pci_assign_unassigned_root_bus_resources().

Using the following QEMU command:

  qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -s -m 2048 $IMAGE \
    -device pcie-root-port,id=root_port1,chassis=1,slot=1 \
    -device x3130-upstream,id=upstream_port1,bus=root_port1 \
    -device
xio3130-downstream,id=downstream_port1,bus=upstream_port1,chassis=2,slot=1 \
    -device
xio3130-downstream,id=downstream_port2,bus=upstream_port1,chassis=2,slot=2 \
    -drive file=${IMGDIR}/nvme.qcow2,if=none,id=nvme1,snapshot=on \
    -device
nvme,drive=nvme1,serial=nvme1,cmb_size_mb=2048,bus=downstream_port1 \
    -drive file=${IMGDIR}/nvme2.qcow2,if=none,id=nvme2,snapshot=on \
    -device nvme,drive=nvme2,serial=nvme1,bus=downstream_port2 \
    -virtfs local,id=home,path=/home/,security_model=mapped,mount_tag=home \
    -nographic \
    -serial mon:stdio \
    -kernel $KERNEL \
    -append "root=/dev/sda2 rootfstype=ext4 console=ttyS0,38400n8"

we can emulate an NVMe device with a 2GB CMB BAR underneath a PCIe
switch with a sibling basic NVMe device for demonstration purposes. The
hack releases the 2GB BAR and all the 32-bit resources in the bus which
*should* be easily reassigned correctly by the code in setup-bus.c
because QEMU had originally found addresses for them. (Note: we do not
even need "pci=realloc" on the command line to hit the bug with this setup.)

When booted, lspci for the NVMe devices shows that all non-prefetchable
resources under the switch were now ignored, but the large 2GB bar was
able to be correctly re-assigned:

After applying patch 1 in this series, the same setup correctly assigns
all resources:
