Ok - I start to understand. What does it mean in HW terms that your
32bit AXI address region size is 32MB ? Please explain to me in details.

IIUC you are using an OARR0 of 128MB in size to map a 32MB address
region, that's what I understand this patch does (and the lowest index
corresponds to the smallest possible size - it is far from clear by
looking at the patch).

Please clarify.
