That is the part that is unclear from your proposal. If we present a
filesystem view, then I am assuming the data will have to be
decompressed first into memory. That means you are proposing use of
30MB uncompressed memory. The whole archive has to be decompressed but
the whole archive if compressed with XZ for a maximum compression
ratio.

But still, decompressing to the filesystem in a scratch area may be
better than decompressing to RAM, for some users who have lesser RAM.
This patchset does not enforce a certain way of doing things and
leaves it to the user.

debugfs is going away for Android and is controversial in the fact
that its functionality isn't guaranteed to be there (debugfs breakages
aren't necessarily bugs AFAIK). So this isn't an option.

Honestly, that's kind of unfair to be quoting just a few points like
that. If I remember there were 100s of emails and many good view
points were brought up by many people. We have done the diligence in
the discussions of this over a period of time.

We have spent the time :) This seems like the best solution of all.
Greg KH and other maintainers are also supportive of it as can be seen
in other threads. We can consider an alternate proposal if it is
better, but I don't see any better one proposed at the moment.

- squashfs-tools requirement on the build really sucks
- cpio uncompressed to memory equally sucks because it consumes all
the memory uncompressed instead of reclaimable pages
- decompressing into tmpfs will suck for Android because we don't use
disk-based swap and we run into the same cpio issue above. We use ZRAM
for compressed swap.
- debugfs is a non-option for Android

The tar+xz is trivially created without depending on squashfs-tools.
And xz provides the maximum compression ratio in our experiments.
Decompression time is a non-issue since trace tools are using it.

The filesystem view sounds using mount/unmount like a pony to me, but
it does not meet the requirements above. Let me know if I am missing
something.

thanks,
 - Joel
