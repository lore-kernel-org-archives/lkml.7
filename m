Hi Peda,

 The

You are reading correctly. I could have made more clear that the issue
pointed out by Russell is not handled by this series but discussion
about it is welcome / needed to decide if we can take this series as is
or if we need to redesign it. But here we are anyhow :)

Good, that was my conclusion as well. The series, as is, doesn't change
the locking behaviour, so that will work exactly as before. Or, it will
not work in the case described by Russell. Like before.

That was my gut feeling, too...

=2E.. and sadly, this too. We would need the same kind of flag which I
described in my first paragraph of the original posting where I wanted
the flag to detect "unauthorized" uses of late I2C transfers. And this
is gonna be invasive. And I am not sure it is worth the effort.

I wonder what a reasonable effort is? Simply ignore the lock from the
"current" adapter and hope for the best that there is no mux or at
least no mux which needs interrupts / a lock attached to it?

Yes. The idea of having two seperate SMBus controllers in one SoC which
would need demuxing is amusing, but still, it exists for I2C and you are
right.

Thanks,
