Yes, correct. The patch that I mentioned only adds semantic patch which
find places with such problem and can generate a regular patch to change
locking. Here is that place for pci/switchtec:

https://lab.nexedi.com/kirr/linux/commit/edaeb4101860?expand_all_diffs=1#ccc4baef911c8dad164d4ff29a8c0b287abed7c2_393_393

It is a problem either if its counterpart is in write _or_ if that
wait_event depends on external source and waiting can be for potentially
unbounded time, like e.g. waiting to receive a character from serial
port or network.

But you are right that even with wait_event used, cases are possible that
there is no blocking that depend on external source and it could be just
e.g. spawn kernel thread to do some limited amount of work and wait for
it to complete. I did not taught stream_open.cocci about that because
when something goes wrong with semantic patch and Coccinelle complains,
it is hard to understand what is going on, and because generally it is
better to convert files that do not depend on position, even if there is
no deadlock at all, to stream_open - i.e. don't do any f_pos_lock
locking at all.
