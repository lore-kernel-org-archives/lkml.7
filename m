Hi, Zhong,

IIUC the problem is that above mm (of the mm->owner) is the child
process's mm rather than the uffd monitor's.  When
dup_userfaultfd_complete() is called there will be a new userfaultfd
context sent to the uffd monitor thread which linked to the chlid
process's mm, and if the monitor thread do UFFDIO_COPY upon the newly
received userfaultfd it'll operate on that new mm too.
