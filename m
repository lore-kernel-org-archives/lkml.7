That patch was not intended to be a fix; it was just to test my guess
that the quirk might be related.

Removing the quirk solved the problem *you're* seeing, but the quirk
was added in the first place to solve some other problem, and if we
simply remove the quirk, we may reintroduce the original problem.

So we have to look at the history and figure out some way to solve
both problems.  I cc'd some people who might have insight.  Here are
some commits that look relevant:

  5ae70296c85f ("mmc: Disabler for Ricoh MMC controller")
  03cd8f7ebe0c ("ricoh_mmc: port from driver to pci quirk")
