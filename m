Subject: [PATCH v2 3/3] x86/kdump/64: Change the upper limit of crashkernel reservation

Restrict kdump to only reserve crashkernel below 64TB. Since the kdump
jumping may be from 5-level to 4-level, and the kdump kernel is put
above 64TB in 5-level kernel, then the jumping will fail. And the
crashkernel reservation is done during the 1st kernel bootup, there's
no way to detect the paging mode of kdump kernel at that time.

Hence change the upper limit of crashkernel reservation to 64TB
on x86_64.
