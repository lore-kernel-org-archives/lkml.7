My apologies for not spotting this during review.

This can't be fixed by setting the IRQF_ONESHOT flag because the IRQ is
always shared with pciehp, dpc and other port services, which do not set
the flag, so you'd get a flags mismatch error in __setup_irq().

The solution is thus to acknowledge the interrupt in
pcie_bw_notification_handler() and move the portion which may sleep
to a separate function which is used as IRQ thread.  In other words,
move the down_read() / up_read() portion to a separate function and
return IRQ_WAKE_THREAD instead of IRQ_HANDLED.

The reason why it didn't show up on your test machines is likely that
they're using MSI on all PCIe ports, whereas Linus' machines appear
to possess at least one PCIe port which uses legacy INTx interrupts.
(MSI sets IRQCHIP_ONESHOT_SAFE for the irq_chip.)

Thanks,

Lukas
