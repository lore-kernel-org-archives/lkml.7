Let me give you an example how I got into this:

do_sigaction() acquires p->sighand->siglock and then iterates over list
via for_each_thread() which is a list_for_each_entry_rcu(). No RCU lock
is held, just the siglock.
On removal side, __unhash_process() removes a task from the list but
while doing so it holds the siglock and tasklist_lock. So it is
perfectly fine.
Later, we have:
|do_exit()
| -> exit_notify()
|   -> write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
|   -> forget_original_parent()
|      -> find_child_reaper()
|        -> find_alive_thread()
|           -> for_each_thread()

find_alive_thread() does the for_each_thread() and checks PF_EXITING.
it might be enough for not operating on "removed" task_struct. It
dereferences task_struct->flags while looking for PF_EXITING. At this
point only tasklist_lock is acquired.
I have *no* idea if the whole synchronisation based on siglock/
PF_EXITING/ tasklist_lock is enough and RCU simply doesn't matter. It
seems so.

I am a little worried if this construct here (or somewhere else) assumes
that holding one of those locks, which disable preemption, is the same
as rcu_read_lock() (or rcu_read_lock_sched()).
