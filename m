Which is the most convenient approach is always dependent on data size and/or even how the data is produced/consumed. It's kind of a spectrum and we're just talking in the sense of probability. You are right that "inarguably" is arguable if the buffer is small enough to fit in registers, and the producer/consumer also has access to registers.

I'm NOT ruling out your approach.

And like you said, the untrusted stack enables certain trickery that helps debugging and also simplifies enclaves (even just a little). Then why are you trying to rule that out? Because of 9 LOC in vDSO?

Don't get me wrong. I never said enclaves would require untrusted stack to make ocalls, or ocalls would require untrusted stack to make. It's just a generic approach for sharing/exchanging data. Some enclaves my need it, others may not.

My question still remains: why do you want to rule it out?

Everything exists for a reason. It's unimportant what has been done. What matters is why that was done in that particular way. I was trying to inspire thinking.

I'm so sorry to tell you that you have misunderstood the SDM. If this is a common misunderstanding, I guess I could talk to the architect responsible for this SDM chapter to see if we could amend the language.

The purpose of restoring RSP is because software needs a stack to handle exception. Well, that's not 100% accurate because it's a user mode stack. Anyway, it tells the used part from the unused space in the stack. RBP on the other hand is NEVER required from interrupt/exception handling perspective, but we decided to add it because we'd like to offer a choice, just like I said earlier. The calling thread could then anchor its frame on either RSP or RBP.
