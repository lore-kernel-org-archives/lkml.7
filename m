The location _of_ the archive, sure. But the format of what is in the
tarball, how it is versioned, and how to manage it will have to be
done by every user.

For any script that doesn't depend on some shared system state that
wants to, say, build a eBPF program and load it, it would need to
extract the tarball from scratch to make sure it is the current
correct version of it.

If that's required by all users, why not just present the data in a
way that it can be used directly?

Keeping it around at all times in memory seems like a significant
waste, I agree.

Providing a standard way of presenting the contents without more
requirements on userspace, and without building up new cargo cult
methods for how to prepare the headers, would still be useful though
(see below).

Adding a new tool that is required to use a new feature isn't that bad
-- it's not like you're breaking the build for everyone.

We've also done this before in the past, by importing the tools into
the kernel tree if needed. It can be solved.

Most users will need to decompress it every time they use it anyway,
especially if there's no versioned prefix in the tarball that they can
use to key to a previously decompressed version with the exact same
kernel version and config.

So, if you need to do that anyway, wouldn't it be easier if you just
mounted a FS to get to it. If you're on a system where you can't use
it in-place for resource reasons, you can copy it off and unmount it.
No extra tools needed in userspace then at run/use time.

Said filesystem could be populated by a compressed cpio archive since
we already have code in the kernel to do this for initramfs, and could
do so at mount time -- and at unmount time it'd be freed up.

If you absolutely need to export a file to userspace with the archive,
my suggestion is to do it through debugfs. That way the format isn't
in a /proc ABI that can't be changed in the future (debugfs isn't
required to be stable in the same way). This way we can change the
format carried in the kernel over time without changing the official
way we present the data to userspace (via a filesystem view).

As far as format goes; there's clear precedent on cpio being used and
supported; we already have build time requirements on the userspace
tools with some options. Using tar would actually be a new dependency
even if it is a common tool to have installed. With a self-populating
FS, there's no new tool requirements on the runtime side either.

I've found some of the old discussion and read up on it. I think it
was pretty quick at dismissing ideas for more robust implementations
("it needs squashfs-tools"), and had some narrow viewpoints (exporting
a tarball is the least amount of kernel change, while adding
complexity at the system/usage side).

I'd also like to clarify: I'm not opposed to the general idea of
providing the needed headers with the kernel somehow. I just think
it's worth spending effort making sure an interface for it that we'll
need to live with forever is appropriately thought through and not
rushed in, especially since we're likely to get substantial
infrastructure on top of it quickly (eBPF and friends in particular).
