Hi Stefan,

Thanks for your comments and testing! I will fix the issues you

During the discussion with Peter, he stated we need irqs_disabled()
because 'system_state > SYSTEM_RUNNING' alone won't do.

Yes, I kinda gave up on white-listing late I2C transfers. My hope is
that not too many drivers will have an atomic callback, so the WARN will
trigger often enough to find late transfers which are inappropriate.

Another idea just popping up: Maybe we can improve that even further by
first globally disabling atomic transfers. Drivers knowing they need
this can then call an I2C core helper to enable them (again globally).
Still not perfect as some unwanted late I2C transfers from another
driver could slip through, but this should be rare enough. The pro-side
is we will detect more unwanted late transfers if support for them is
default off. It should be noted that "disabling" means keeping the old
behaviour which is: we try the regular transfer but complain about it.
Only enabling atomic will make the core quiet.

Regards,

   Wolfram
