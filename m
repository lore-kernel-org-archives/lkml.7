I don't think this will work. The problem is when the sub-drivers need
to send a report or usb-command: how to they specify which hdev the
report/command is destined for? While we could store the original hdev
in each report (the hid_report's device field), that only works for
hid_hw_request(), but not for things like hid_hw_raw_request() or
hid_hw_output_report(). Now, currently I don't use the latter two; but
I do need to send raw usb control messages in the touchbar driver
(some commands are not proper hid reports), so it definitely breaks
down there.

Or am I missing something?


  Cheers,

  Ronald
