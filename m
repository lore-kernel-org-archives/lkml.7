I agree that the amount of work in this patch set is about the same
(although you don't have to pass the information about reference type in
the biovec so you save the complexities there). But for the future the
rule that "bio references must be gup-pins" is IMO easier to grasp for
developers and you can reasonably assert it in bio_add_page().

So what's the difference whether the page reference has been acquired via
GUP or via some other means? I don't think that really matters. If say
infiniband introduced new ioctl() that takes file descriptor, offset, and
length and just takes pages from page cache and attaches them to their RDMA
scatter-gather lists, then they'd need to use 'pin' references anyway...

Then why do we work on differentiating between GUP pins and other page
references?  Because it matters what the reference is going to be used for
and what is it's lifetime. And generally GUP references are used to do IO
to/from page and may even be controlled by userspace so that's why we need
to make them different. But in principle the 'gup-pin' reference is not about
the fact that the reference has been obtained from GUP but about the fact
that it is used to do IO. Hence I think that the rule "bio references must
be gup-pins" makes some sense.
