I mentioned this earlier:

I saw that in commits like 746cdfbf01c0 ("hwmon: Avoid building drivers 
forpowerpc that read/write ISA addresses"), PPC would not build these
drivers, as, like arm, it has no native ISA.

However I still don't think just avoiding compiling these drivers for 
certain archs solves the problem.

I doubt that it can work now.

Since we when introduced the concept of logical PIO space, this IO space 
became sparely populated by 2 regions - MMIO and indirect IO - so we 
cannot grow it as we map in regions. I also don't think it works for 
when we IO unmap regions.

Thanks,
John
