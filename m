We agree that a dbx would be useful for blacklisting particular kernels
signed with given certificate. However, we have been avoiding doing so for
the initial release of secure boot on OpenPOWER. We don't have individual
firmware binaries in OpenPOWER. Kernels are currently the only concern for
the OS secure boot certificates we're discussing here. Also, we have a very
limited keystore space in POWER9.

Petitboot doesn't have standardized OS kernel verification at all right
now.  Having the capability even without dbx seems valuable.

We support a subset of standard EFI variable attributes, and we only use
EFI variables that relate to secure boot. Our goal is not to implement
UEFI.  However, we do seek to be compatible with user space tooling and
reuse as much existing infrastructure as possible. We don’t support the
following: EFI_VARIABLE_HARDWARE_ERROR_RECORD,
EFI_VARIABLE_AUTHENTICATED_WRITE_ACCESS and
EFI_VARIABLE_ENHANCED_AUTHENTICATED_ACCESS.

Our secure variable updates are only applied at boot time. If any one of
them fails, they all fail.

In OpenPOWER systems, we enable our customers and business partners to
establish and manage the platform key certificate, which is the root of our
key hierarchy. From there, through the KEK, they can delegate authority to
intermediate level organizations, e.g. distros or IT departments or
business operations. Those intermediate level organizations then manage the
code signing certificates in the DB. If this answer doesn’t address your
question, can you please rephrase?


Thanks,
Claudio
