Patches 2+3 in this series are the attempt to solve it.

The solution is not in handling an abort generated in accessing the 
unmapped region, but rather avoiding any potential abort and just 
discard the access if the region is unmapped. This is done in the IO 
port accessors, by checking if a PCI host has registered a region in 
"logical PIO" space.

For more info on logical PIO space, see commits 031e3601869c ("lib: Add 
generic PIO mapping method") and 5745392e0c2b ("PCI: Apply the new 
generic I/O management on PCI IO hosts").

In these patches, I add a check in memory-mapped IO port region accesses 
to ensure that a PCI host has registered a region, i.e. IO ports are mapped.

With these patches, we now get the following on an arm64 system with no 
PCI host:

Note: I've removed a WARN_ONCE from the patches for this experiment. 
Maybe I'll permanently remove.

Without the patches:

@Guenter, sorry for citing a hwmon driver again as triggering a crash...
