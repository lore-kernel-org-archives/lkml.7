+Abstract
+========
 This document describes the ACPICA project and the relationship between
 ACPICA and Linux.  It also describes how ACPICA code in drivers/acpi/acpica,
 include/acpi and tools/power/acpi is automatically updated to follow the
 upstream.
 
+ACPICA Project
+==============
 
-1. ACPICA Project
-
-   The ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) project provides an operating
-   system (OS)-independent reference implementation of the Advanced
-   Configuration and Power Interface Specification (ACPI).  It has been
-   adapted by various host OSes.  By directly integrating ACPICA, Linux can
-   also benefit from the application experiences of ACPICA from other host
-   OSes.
