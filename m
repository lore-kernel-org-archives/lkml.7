Yes it does, keyword being "normal".  Though I guess we could do a bit of
bikeshedding on the definition of normal...

Actually, this series doesn't force anything on Intel's SDK, as there is
nothing in the documentation that states the vDSO *must* be used to enter
enclaves.  In other words, unless it's expressly forbidden, applications
are free to enter enclaves directly and do as they wish with the untrusted
stack.  The catch being that any such usage will need to deal with enclave
exceptions being delivered as signals, i.e. the vDSO implementation is a
carrot, not a stick.

AIUI, excepting libraries that want to manipulate the untrusted stack,
there is a general consensus that the proposed vDSO implementation is the
right approach, e.g. full x86_64 ABI compatibility was explored in the
past and was deemed to add unnecessary complexity and overhead.

The vDSO *could* be written in such a way that it supports preserving RBP
or RSP, but for all intents and purposes such an implementation would yield
two distinct ABIs that just happen to be implemented in a single function.
And *if* we want to deal with maintaining two ABIs, supporting the kernel's
existing signal ABI is a lot cleaner (from a kernel perspective) than
polluting the vDSO.

In other words, if there is a desire to support enclaves which modify
the untrusted stack, and it sounds like there is, then IMO our time is
better spent discussing whether or not to officially support the signal
ABI for enclaves.

I think Andy's point is that a single PUSH (to save %rcx) won't break
unwinding, etc..., but unwinders and whantot will have a rough go of it
if %rsp points at complete garbage.

It's not just the performance cost, making __vdso_sgx_enter_enclave()
compatible with the x86_64 ABI adds complexity to both its code and its
documentation, e.g. to describe how data is marshalled to/from enclaves.
