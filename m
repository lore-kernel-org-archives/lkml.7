Yes, it does use as much and as tight resources as it possible, but
only for the case of pure integer ports numbering. While in case if
there are gaps in the port numbers space (which is the only case we have
in supported hardware at this moment) it will lead to a failure if there
are ports with higher numbers, than there are MWs available (MWs availability
depends on the IDT chip firmware). Additionally it creates gaps in the MWs
space if physical ports are numbered with gaps. Since the only multi-port
device we've got now is IDT and it always has it' ports numbered with gaps as I
described, then the current implementation will definitely produced the
problems.

Exactly. The table will look even worse for the port numbers: 0 2 4 6 8 12 16 20.

Yes, this is how it used to be done in ntb_pingpong and is still done in the
ntb_perf driver. And it is correctly working. As I already described and
you wrote further, this table provides a Logical Ports numbering space:

peer port \ local port   0  2  4  6  8  12  16  20
        0                0  0  0  0  0   0   0   0
        2                1  1  1  1  1   1   1   1
        4                2  2  2  2  2   2   2   2
        6                3  3  3  3  3   3   3   3
        8                4  4  4  4  4   4   4   4
       12                5  5  5  5  5   5   5   5
       16                6  6  6  6  6   6   6   6
       20                7  7  7  7  7   7   7   7

(although I'd call it Global Port Indexes space)

Currently local port indexes don't enumerate the local port number. So
if you convert that table into the one you provided in the function
comment, then it'll look like this (similar to what you called incorrect):

pidx \ port     0  2  4  6  8  12  16  20
 0              1  0  0  0  0   0   0   0
 1              2  2  1  1  1   1   1   1
 2              3  3  3  2  2   2   2   2
 3              4  4  4  4  3   3   3   3
 4              5  5  5  5  5   4   4   4
 5              6  6  6  6  6   6   5   5
 6              7  7  7  7  7   7   7   6

Yes, by using this table we'll waste one resource as always existing
gap (is it the only incorrect thing you had in mind?). But it is smaller
problem than to use physical port numbers, which produces much bigger gaps
in case of your table implementation as well.

Note, in addition in this case you'd need to reconsider your algorithm of the
resources initialization. Lets for example take alook at Port 0. You'd need
to have its outbound memory windows [1-7] pointing to the peers with ports
[2,4,...,20] (correspond to pidx [0-6] of Port 0). So in this case Port 2 would
have a port 0 inbound MW #1 retrieving data from Port 0 outbound MW #1, Port 4
would have a port 0 inbound MW #2 retrieving data from Port 0 outbound MW #2,
and so on.

So your current approach is inbound MW-centralized, while mine is developed
around the outbound MWs.

That's what I suggested in the two possible solutions:
1st solution: replace current pidx with Logical Port Number,
2nd solution: alter ntb_peer_resource_idx() so it would return the Logical Port Number.

IMO In case of the 2nd solution I'd also suggest to rename the
ntb_peer_resource_idx() method into ntb_peer_port_global_idx(),
and then consider the current port indexes used in the NTB API
as local port indexes. The resource indexing can be abstracted
by a macro like this:
#define ntb_peer_resource_idx ntb_peer_port_global_idx

Finally in order to close the space up we'd also need to define
a method: ntb_port_global_idx(), which would return a Logical (global)
index of local port.

Current port numbers are the physical port numbers with gaps. That's why we
introduced the port-index NTB API abstraction in the first place, to have these gaps
eliminated and to provide a simple way of bulk setup. Although that abstraction
turned out not that suitable to distribute the shared resources. So
the Logical (Global) indexing is needed to do it (that's what ntb_pingpong used
to do and ntb_perf still does now).

Absolutely agree with you. The main idea of NTB API was to provide a set
of methods to access the NTB hardware without any abstractions but
with possible useful helpers, like your NTB MSI library, or transport library,
or anything else. So the physical port numbers must be available for
the client drivers.

This is the main question. Do we really need the current port indexes
implementation at all? After all these years of NTB API usage I don't really
see it useful in any case except to loop over the outbound MW resources
automatically skipping the local port (usefulness of this is also questionable).
As I already said I created the port-index table this way due to the IDT NTB
MWs peculiarity, which doesn't seem to me a big problem now comparing to all
these additional complications we intend to introduce.

The rest of the drivers code really need to have the Logical (global)
port indexes, at least to distribute the shared resources, and don't use
the current pidx that much.

Wouldn't it be better to just redefine the current port-index table
in the following way?
ntb_port_number() - local physical port number,
ntb_port_idx() - local port logical (global) index,
ntb_peer_port_count() - total number of ports NTB device provide (including the local one),
ntb_peer_port_number() - physical port number of the peer with passed logical port index,
ntb_peer_port_idx - logical port index of the passed physical port number.

while currently we have:
ntb_port_number() - local physical port number,
ntb_peer_port_count() - total number of ports NTB device provide (excluding the local one),
ntb_peer_port_number() - physical port number of the peer with passed port index,
ntb_peer_port_idx - port index of the passed physical port number;
