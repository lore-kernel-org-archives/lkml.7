Thanks!  I doubt either of those commits is the real problem, but
they're both related to system_state, so it's conceivable they're both
involved in exposing the problem.

Thanks for that.

The successful boot continues on with this:

  [   10.675996] pci 0000:00:1a.0: quirk_usb_early_handoff+0x0/0x6a0 took 22519 usecs
  [   10.684519] pci 0000:03:00.0: [Firmware Bug]: disabling VPD access (can't determine size of non-standard VPD for)
  [   10.696404] pci 0000:03:00.0: quirk_blacklist_vpd+0x0/0x30 took 11605 usecs
  [   10.704515] pci 0000:0b:00.0: Video device with shadowed ROM at [mem 0x000c0000-0x000dffff]

So apparently the hang happens while we're running the "final" PCI
fixups.  This happens after all the rest of PCI is initialized.

Can you boot v5.0 vanilla with "initcall_debug"?  Maybe we can narrow
it down to a specific quirk.
