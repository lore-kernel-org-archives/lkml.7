Ah yes, I've seen these. They have an MMIO path to their internal
registers in addition to cfg. Can be annoying.

Right.

Amen brother. It will take a little while to get there. One thing we
should do is have a clearer way to mark a resource that failed to
assign/allocate (though technically parent=NULL is it really, as long
as all archs these days claim properly, it used not to be the case).

We do wipe *bridge* windows (nor BARs) all over the place, that is less
of an issue I suppose though I would be more comfortable if we also
wrote to the bridge to close those windows as we do so...

The problem of course is how much old weird quirky will break due to
subtle assumptions as we "fix" these things :-)

Right, shouldn't it be pci_is_bridge() ?

Yup.

Yeah quite possibly.

Cheers,
Ben.
