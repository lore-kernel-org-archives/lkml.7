I don't think update of Intel hash would be frequent, like you said all current processors with SGX support may should be using the same value.

Thus I am expecting I can run Intel SDK on KVM guest if LC feature flag is cleared.

Even Intel has updated the key, SDK should mention those impacted machine should run SDK starting from some new version, so SDK should continue to run.

I am not following. KVM can do whatever it wants, but it cannot change the fact that KVM guest cannot run intel enclave if platform's MSRs are configured to 3rd party and locked.

Or am I misunderstanding?

One example is EPCM + EPC should be power of 2. And EPC migration (sudden loss of EPC). And if we apply some policy to restrict enclave during EINIT trap, etc.

But those are not the point. I should probably have not mentioned them.

OK.

But IMO if what I mentioned above is correct, then that part should overweight the benefit you can get here.

Anyway who cares to do less/more thing in driver probe?

Thanks,
