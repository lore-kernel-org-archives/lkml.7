I'm not sure yet about your approach, I need to think and analyze this a 
little more.

I also believe that probably we need to ensure that current user data 
line seq_id is always above the current GC line seq_id or sth like that. 
We cannot also then GC any data from the lines which are still open, but 
I believe that this is a case even right now.
