Thank you for kicking off this conversation.

Every architecture should have a reasonable RSEQ_SIG that applies to their
ISA with a comment about why that instruction was chosen. It should be a
conscious choice, without a default.

Suggest:

* Support for automatically registering threads with the Linux rseq(2)
   system call has been added.  This system call is implemented starting
   from Linux 4.18.  The Restartable Sequences ABI accelerates user-space
   operations on per-cpu data.  It allows user-space to perform updates
   on per-cpu data without requiring heavy-weight atomic operations.
   Automatically registering threads allows all libraries, including libc,
   to make immediate use of the rseq(2) support by using the documented ABI.
   See 'man 2 rseq' for the details of the ABI shared between libc and the
   kernel.

In the event that you accidentally jump to it then you trap?

However, you want an *uncommon* trap insn.

I think the order of preference is:

1.  An uncommon insn (with random immediate values), in a literal pool, that is
     not a useful ROP/JOP sequence (very uncommon)
2a. A uncommon TRAP hopefully with some immediate data encoded (maybe uncommon)
2b. A NOP to avoid affecting speculative execution (maybe uncommon)

With 2a/2b being roughly equivalent depending on speculative execution policy.

Yes please.

You also want to avoid the value being a valid MIPS insn that's common.

Did you check that?

Yes, I think it needs to be a valid uncommon insn or nop.

That makes perfect sense. Thanks.

So what is left to audit?

In summary:

- Why does AArch64 choose a trap?

- Is the current choice of 0x53053053 OK for MIPS? Does it map to a valid insn?

- What better choice is there for power? Pick a real uncommon insn or nop?

- What better choice is there for s390? Pick a real uncommon insn or nop?
   - Todays choice could become something special in the future since it's unassigned.
