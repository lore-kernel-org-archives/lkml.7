Please don't make this an SBI call.  We need a proper instruction
for cache flushing and invalidation.  We'll also need that for pmem
support for example.  I heard at least one other vendor already
had an instruction, and we really need to get this into the privileged
spec ASAP (yesterday in fact).

If you have your own instructions already we can probably binary
patch those in using the Linux alternatives mechanism once we have
a standardized way in the privileged spec.

We should probably start a working group for this ASAP unless we can
get another working group to help taking care of it.

Nitpick: this can be shortened to

	return __pgprot(pgprot_val(prot) | _PAGE_COHERENCY));

Also is this really a coherent flag, or an 'uncached' flag like in
many other architectures?

This should probably be called dma-noncoherent.c

It should also have a user visible config option so that we don't
have to build it for fully coherent systems.

No need for this memset, the caller takes care of it.

I think ioremap is a different story, and should be a separate patch.
