The major reason is we don't want to maintain 2 different ABIs (preserving %rsp vs. %rbp). Given the new one covers all known use cases, we prefer not to keep the other one.

I know very little about kernel-doc. Not quite sure which markup means what. Or if you don't mind, could you just write up the whole thing (you have written half of it in your email already) so I can include it into my next revision?

Looping IMO is indeed the common case. Just think of the case of an enclave making a sequence of o-calls.

The above instruction (i.e. jrcxz) does test %rcx.

I wouldn't nullify @exinfo at EEXIT because that could be used as a "context" pointer to the callback.

Making it optionally because the callback can still use other registers (e.g. %rdi) determine the reason without it. For example, an enclave may set %rdi to non-zero to signify o-call/e-ret while zero (as set by AEX) would indicate an exception. My intention is not to impose unnecessary restrictions on applications.

I'd still prefer sgx_enclave_exinfo to imply its use in both _ex_it and _ex_ception cases, for the reason stated above.

I'd prefer more concise code. After all, this is assembly without optimization done by the compiler. If it were for C, I'd agree with you because either case would end up in roughly the same code (in terms of code size or efficiency) due to the optimizer.

I know very little about kernel-doc. Would you please point me to documents describing it? What you suggested here will of course be incorporated into my next revision.

%rax was loaded only 2 instructions ago, while what %rbx is containing is described in the comment immediately above it. I think I have done my best to make it readable. After all, this is assembly so can't expect something like giving proper names to variables in C because that just can't be done in assembly.

You have probably misunderstood my code. 'ret' is _not_ passed while @exinfo is passed in %rcx. exinfo->leaf implies the reason of the callback.

Or are you suggesting to add 'ret' as one more parameter to the callback? I don't think it necessary because exinfo contains everything the callback would ever need.

Your code will work. The only missing thing is a ".cfi_def_cfa %rbp, 16" after 'ret' instruction in block 4. I decided to keep "leave; ret" at the end to avoid confusion around the frame pointer. As you may also notice, GCC generated code usually does the same thing.
