Yes I do see this patch a useful addition. When you need the header and you're
dealing with multiple devices and kernel trees and versions - having the
headers part of the kernel just makes it easier to use them when you need them.
Especially sometimes when you change a config option (like enabling a new
syscall e.g: bpf) it's very easy to forget that the headers has changed as well
and you need to push an updated copy.

FWIW most of the time I run on non-android systems for development/debugging
purposes. I use the built-in version although I can see a module version
helpful too. You can save some space if your kernel image partition is small
and it's easy to install the module along with all other modules when
rebuilding the kernel than remembering to update the headers. It's a (very)
nice convenience.
