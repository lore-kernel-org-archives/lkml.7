DRV_VERSION here is not used for API availablity. :)

Actually this patch doesn't introduce new APIs, I am trying to make this
transparent to endusers. That means users don't need to know it's a 32bit
PR or a faster 512bit one, they still use the same IOCTL interface for PR.

the API_VERSION and CHECK_EXTENSION ioctls have been defined, but I think
at least we don't need to bump them for this change. How do you think?

Yes, agree.
