Not particularily trying to be annoying here but I find the above
rather hard to parse :) I know what you're getting at but I'm not sure
somebody who doesn't will understand.

One way would be to instead prefix the whole thing with a blurb along
the lines of:

	readX() and writeX() provide some ordering guarantees versus
        each other and other memory accesses that are described below. 
	Those guarantees apply to accesses performed either by the same
        logical thread of execution, or by different threads but while 
        holding the same lock (spinlock or mutex).

Then have as simpler description of each case. No ?
