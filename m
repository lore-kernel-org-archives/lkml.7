Thank you. I rewrote the log and pushed patches to pci/iproc, please
have a look (Ray/Scott please do have a look too) and report back
if that's fine.

Do you agree that the initial commit was lacking _significant_
information ? Please remember that the commit log plays a fundamental
part in understanding a change and this one is a very important one
so I am being pedantic on it.

Thanks,
Lorenzo
