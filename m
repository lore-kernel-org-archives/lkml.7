From my POV, the fact that livepatches make use of ftrace handlers
is just an implementation detail. Ideally, users should not know
about it. The livepatch handlers should be handled special way
and should not be affected by the ftrace sysfs interface.
And ideally, the ftrace sysfs interface should still be available
for other ftrace users.

I would understand if this would be too complicated and we would
need to find a compromise.

From the livepatch point of view it would be more reliable if
ftrace_ops with PERMANENT flag would force "ftrace_enabled"
to be always true.

It will make the flag unusable for other ftrace users. But it
will be already be the case when it can't be disabled.
