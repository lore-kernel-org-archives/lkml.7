I have a hard time putting USB insertion and removal into the same
class, the equivalent is PCI hotplug which is logged separately.  Do
we ever log beyond USB device discovery if a device is running at a
lower speed than is possible?  The most directly related is the green
ethernet switch, which you admit was a nuisance due to exactly this
sort of logging.  It was probably confusing to see this logging, perhaps
you wondered if the cable was bad or the switch was defective.

There's a disconnect from above where similar behavior on ethernet
behavior "clogged" the log files, but here we just want to ignore it.
Excessive logging can also be considered a denial of service vector
when the device generating that excessive logging is attached to a
userspace driver.

v5.1 is approaching quickly, can we downgrade these to pci_dbg() while
we work on maybe some sort of driver participation in this logging?
Thanks,
