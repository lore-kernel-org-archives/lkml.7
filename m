Hi Kirtika,

I think the SYSASSERT issue you found is unrelated.  Can we track that
separately? Again, it seems that we're doing something wrong during
recovery, which causes the many warnings and long time to recover...

Regarding the spinlock, I'm not sure.  It seems that we don't need it,
because we're just writing to the register.  Maybe some of the other
blocks that are spinlocked must have a guarantee that no one will
change the register in the middle of it.  But before we add the
spinlocks, we should check if that really is the case.

We'll check the dmesg you sent us, but I think it's better to create a
new issue in the tracker for it.
