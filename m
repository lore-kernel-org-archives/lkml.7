Hi Karim,

Thanks for the explanation!

So how does this work, with kernel images and kernel modules supplied
by separate parties, not "bound" by the same kernel headers/API, as they
can be replaced separately?

Isn't the need for kernel headers for user-space tools something different,
as this is limited to the uapi versions, which are less (almost not) subject
to change, compared to the kernel headers needed for compiling kernel
modules?

Thanks!
