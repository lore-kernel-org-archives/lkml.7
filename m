I think one would expect one set of alighment for any kmalloc object.

"In practice" refers to the current way that slab allocators arrange
objects within the page. They are free to do otherwise if new ideas come
up for object arrangements etc.

The slab allocators already may have to store data in addition to the user
accessible part (f.e. for RCU or ctor). The "natural alighnment" of a
power of 2 cache is no longer as you expect for these cases. Debugging is
not the only case where we extend the object.

As explained before there is nothing "natural" here. Doing so restricts
future features and creates a mess within the allocator of exceptions for
debuggin etc etc (see what happened to SLAB). "Natural" is just a
simplistic thought of a user how he would arrange power of 2 objects.
These assumption should not be made but specified explicitly.

So lets leave it as it is now then.
