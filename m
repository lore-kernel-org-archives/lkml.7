I encountered this situation when using iscsi target as the ext4 volume,
if the network down a while when ext4 write metadata to disk, and maybe
read will success after the network recovered.
In my testcase, just create and delete files, when disconnect the network,
the dir entry maybe corruption. I add some logs when read entry buffer from
disk, the buffer stats maybe buffer_write_io_error() and !buffer_uptodate().
In this case, the ext4 will corruption high probability. Because the buffer
is read from disk, and some newer information just on journal. In this case,
we should not read buffer from the disk.

I don't know any other filesystem how to use the uptodate flag. But I think
uptodate means the buffer is valid and newer than disk, am I right?

I just test ext4 use the xfstest.

Any other idea about my problem?
