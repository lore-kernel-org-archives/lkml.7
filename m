Yes and it is part of this patchset AFAICT iomap use bio_iov_iter_get_pages()
which is updated to pass down wether page are coming from GUP or not. The
bio you get out of that is then release through iomap_dio_bio_end_io() which
calls bvec_put_page() which will use put_user_page() for GUPed page.

I may have miss a case and review are welcome.

Note that while the convertion is happening put_user_page is exactly the same
as put_page() in fact the implementation just call put_page() with nothing
else.

The tricky part is making sure that before we diverge with a put_user_page()
that does something else that put_page() we will need to be sure that we did
not left a path that do GUP but does call put_page() and not put_user_page().
We have some plan to catch that in debug build.

In any case i believe we will be very careful when the times come to change
put_user_page() to something different.

Cheers,
Jérôme
