Yes i know this is a sad state, but if enough people see comments in
enough places we should end up with more eyes aware of the gotcha and
hopefully increase the likelyhood of catching any new user.

Restricting GUP like status to GUP insure that we only ever back-off
because of GUP and not because of some innocuous I/O.

I am working on a v2 that just add a new variant to add page, but i
will have to run (x)fstest before re-posting.

I also have the scatterlist convertion mostly ready:

https://cgit.freedesktop.org/~glisse/linux/log/?h=gup-scatterlist-v1

After that GUP is mostly isolated to individual driver and much easier
to track and update.

Cheers,
Jérôme
