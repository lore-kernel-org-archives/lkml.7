I'm a little uneasy about the bandwidth notification logging as a
whole.  Messages in dmesg don't seem like a solid base for building
management tools.

I assume the eventual goal would be some sort of digested notification
along the lines of "hey mr/ms administrator, the link to device X
unexpectedly became slower, you might want to check that out."

If I were building that, I don't think I would use dmesg.  I might
write a daemon that polls /sys/.../current_link_{speed,width}, or
maybe use some sort of netlink event.  Maybe it would be useful to
have the admin designate devices of interest.

I'm hesitant about adding a .link_change() handler.  If there's
something useful a driver could do with it, that's one thing.  But
using it merely to suppress a message doesn't really seem worth the
trouble, and it seems unfriendly to ask drivers to add it when they
didn't ask for it and get no benefit from it.
