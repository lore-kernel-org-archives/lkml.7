I vehemently disagree with "inarguably".  IMO, passing data via registers
is much more convenient.

Even if you qualify your assertion with "data of arbitrary size unknown
at build time", I still disagree.  Using the untrusted stack allows for
trickery when a debugger is involved, other than that I see no advantages
over allocating virtual memory and handing the pointer to the enclave
at launch time.  Sure, it requires a few more lines of code to setup,
but it's literally ~20 LoC out of thousands required to sign, build and
launch an enclave, but it doesn't require playing games with the stack.

Not to mention that the entire concept of using the untrusted stack is
based on the assumption that the enclave is making ocalls, e.g. stateless
enclaves or libraries that use a message queue have zero need/benefit
for using the untrusted stack.

That's a bit misleading, since almost all existing enclaves are built
against Intel's SDK, which just so happens to unconditionally use the
untrusted stack.  It's not like all enclave developers made a concious
decision to use the untrusted stack.  If Intel rewrote the SDK to use
a different method then one could argue that the new approach is the
most common method of passing data.

I disagree that the SGX ISA intends for applications to choose between
preserving RSP and RBP, e.g. the SDM description of SSA.UR{B,S}P states:

  Non-Enclave (outside) {RBP,stack} pointer. Saved by EENTER, restored on AEX.

To me, the "Saved/restored" wording implies that URBP and URSP should
*never* be touched by the enclave.  Sure, the proposed vDSO interface
doesn't require RBP to be preserved, but only because the goal was to
deviate from hardware as little as possible, not because anyone wants
to encourage enclaves to muck with RBP.
