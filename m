My main gripe with the if (disconnected) model is that it's only
really good for inactive devices. If a device is being used then odds
are the driver will do an MMIO before the pci core has had a chance to
mark the device as broken so you crash anyway.

What's the idea there? Scan the ioremap space for mappings over the
device BARs and swap them with a normal memory page?

Using pci_dev_is_disconnected() to opportunistically avoid waiting for
MMIO timeouts is fair enough IMO, even if it's a bit ugly. It would
help your case if you did some measurements to show the improvement
and look for other cases it might help. It might also be a good idea
to document when it is appropriate to use pci_is_dev_disconnected() so
we aren't stuck having the same argument again and again, but that's
probably a job for Bjorn though.
