Yeah maybe there's a misunderstanding, my comments where in the
context of the submitted xilinx driver, and similar drivers that mean
to expose fpgas to userspace for doing stuff. If all you use your FGPA
for is to load a bitstream as a firmware blob, to then instantiate a
device which doesn't really change anymore, then then bistream is just
like firmware indeed. But we're talking about kernel/userspace api,
where (possible multiple) unpriviledged clients can do whatever they
feel like, and where we have pretty hard requirements about not
breaking userspace. To be able to fully review and more or less
indefinitely support such driver stacks, we need to understand what
they're doing and what's possible. It's the "unpriviledge userspace
submits touring complete (ok sometimes not quite touring complete, but
really powerful i/o is usually on the menu) blobs to be run on
questionable hardware by the kernel" which is the part that
distinguishes a firmware blob from the compute kernels we're talking
about here. It's not gpu vs fpga vs something else. From a kernel
driver pov those are all the same: You take a
shader/bitstream/whatever blob + a bit of state/configuration from
userspace, and need to make sure there's no DOS or other exploit in
there.

And we're not going to take "there's no problem here" on blind faith,
because we know how well designed&validated hw is. This isn't new with
smeltdown, because gpus have been very fragile/broken/insecure pieces
since forever (it's slowly getting better though, and we rely ever
less on sw to guarantee isolation).

Wrt drivers/fpga: My understanding is that's very much meant to allow
unpriviledge userspace to use them, at least they wouldn't need an
ioctl interface otherwise.
