The max #queue is also limited by other factors, e.g., kernel param
configuration, xen dom0 configuration or nvme hardware support.

Here we would ignore those factors for simplicity and only talk about the
relation between #queue and #cpu.


About nvme pci:

Regardless about new write_queues and poll_queues, the default queue type number
is limited by num_possible_cpus() as line 2120 and 252.

2113 static int nvme_setup_io_queues(struct nvme_dev *dev)
2114 {
2115         struct nvme_queue *adminq = &dev->queues[0];
2116         struct pci_dev *pdev = to_pci_dev(dev->dev);
2117         int result, nr_io_queues;
2118         unsigned long size;
2119
2120         nr_io_queues = max_io_queues();
2121         result = nvme_set_queue_count(&dev->ctrl, &nr_io_queues);

 250 static unsigned int max_io_queues(void)
 251 {
 252         return num_possible_cpus() + write_queues + poll_queues;
 253 }

The cons of this is there might be many unused hw queues and vectors when
num_possible_cpus() is very very large while only a small number of cpu are
online. I am looking if there is way to improve this.



About xen-blkfront:

Indeed the max #queue is limited by num_online_cpus() when xen-blkfront module
is loaded as line 2733 and 2736.

2707 static int __init xlblk_init(void)
... ...
2710         int nr_cpus = num_online_cpus();
... ...
2733         if (xen_blkif_max_queues > nr_cpus) {
2734                 pr_info("Invalid max_queues (%d), will use default max: %d.\n",
2735                         xen_blkif_max_queues, nr_cpus);
2736                 xen_blkif_max_queues = nr_cpus;
2737         }

The cons of this is the number of hw-queue/hctx is limited and cannot increase
after cpu hotplug. I am looking if there is way to improve this.


While both have cons for cpu hotplug, they are trying to make #vector
proportional to the number of cpu.


For xen-blkfront and virtio-blk, as (set=nr_maps == 1), the number of hw queue
is limited by nr_cpu_ids again at block layer.


As virtio-blk is a PCI device, can we use the solution in nvme, that is, to use
num_possible_cpus to limited the max queues in virtio-blk?

Thank you very much!
