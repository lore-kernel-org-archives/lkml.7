Not sure I understood that. Now we are disabling the ability to map
pages as huge pages. I am now considering that this should not be
user configurable. Ie, this is something that platform can use to avoid
dax forcing huge page mapping, but if the architecture can enable huge
dax mapping, we should always default to using that.

Now w.r.t to failures, can device-dax do an opportunistic huge page
usage? I haven't looked at the device-dax details fully yet. Do we make the
assumption of the mapping page size as a format w.r.t device-dax? Is that
derived from nd_pfn->align value?

Here is what I am working on:
1) If the platform doesn't support huge page and if the device superblock
indicated that it was created with huge page support, we fail the device
init.

2) Now if we are creating a new namespace without huge page support in
the platform, then we force the align details to PAGE_SIZE. In such a
configuration when handling dax fault even with THP enabled during
the build, we should not try to use hugepage. This I think we can
achieve by using TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAEG_DAX_FLAG.

Also even if the user decided to not use THP, by
echo "never" > transparent_hugepage/enabled , we should continue to map
dax fault using huge page on platforms that can support huge pages.

This still doesn't cover the details of a device-dax created with
PAGE_SIZE align later booted with a kernel that can do hugepage dax.How
should we handle that? That makes me think, this should be a VMA flag
which got derived from device config? May be use VM_HUGEPAGE to indicate
if device should use a hugepage mapping or not?
