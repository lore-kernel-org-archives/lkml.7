And there is nvme problem on AMD IOMMU:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=202665

While page_frag_alloc() should be used with cautious, at least care of
size alignment with ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN (not for IOMMU, but standard arch
dma), at this point I think some of those issues are AMD IOMMU problems.

Any comment on that? Is fine or not to do 2 or more dma mappings
within the same single page on AMD IOMMU? If not, is there any
mechanism for drivers to find out about this limitation to prevent
to prepare wrong SG buffers?

I think I found a bug in amd iommu code when setting sg->dma_address
with sg->offset > PAGE_SIZE. Will post fix shortly.
