Other PCIe host controllers work that way too - I know, because I've got 
one here. In this particular case, it's not explicit "restriction" so 
much as just that the window configuration controls what AXI attributes 
are generated on the master side of the PCIe-AXI bridge, and there is no 
default attribute. Thus if a PCIe transaction doesn't hit one of the 
windows it simply cannot propagate across to the AXI side because the RC 
won't know what attributes to emit. It may be conceptually a very 
slightly different problem statement, but it still wants the exact same 
solution.

And ACPI has a direct equivalent of dma-ranges in the form of the _DMA 
method - compare of_dma_get_range() and acpi_dma_get_range(). Again, 
platforms already exist which have this kind of hardware limitation and 
boot with both DT and ACPI.

The general concept of devices having inaccessible holes within their 
nominal DMA mask ultimately boils down to how creative SoC designers can 
be with interconnect topologies, so in principle it could end up being 
relevant just about anywhere. But as I implied before, since the 
examples we know about today all seem to be PCIe IPs, it's not all that 
unreasonable to start with this PCI-specific workaround now, and 
generalise it later as necessary.

Sure, I get that - sorry if it was unclear, but all I meant was simply 
taking the flow you currently have, i.e.:

pcie-iproc: parse dma-ranges and make list of gaps between regions
dma-iommu: process list and reserve entries

and tweaking it into this:

pcie-iproc: parse dma-ranges and make list of regions
dma-iommu: process list and reserve gaps between entries

which has the nice benefit of being more robust since the first step can 
easily construct the list in correctly-sorted order regardless of the 
order in which the DT ranges appear.

Robin.
