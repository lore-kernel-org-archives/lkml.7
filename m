devtmpfs is something that the kernel can do *better* than userspace.
The userspace equivalent is error-prone. Unpacking an archive, on the
other hand, is trivial. Does userspace really need the kernel's help
to do tar xvf? Are we really so worried about userspace getting tar
xvf wrong somehow that we should provide tar xvf in the kernel? The
kernel should have a feature only if there's some particular reason to
put that feature in the kernel instead of userspace. A smaller kernel
is a better kernel, all things being equal.

It's also worth noting that years and years ago, many proposals to do
what udevd does (but in the kernel) failed to make it into the kernel.

Consider the embedded case: who's to say that the machine
decompressing the header bundle is the machine that provides it? We
can suck a compressed archive off the device without ever
decompressing it. I know you that you proposed providing access to
both a compressed cpio archive and a filesystem view of that archive,
but in this scheme, the filesystem view is redundant. If someone wants
a filesystem view of an archive, he can make one with FUSE without the
kernel's help and in a general way.

Breaking this header bundle *should* be a bug though: tools will rely
on it. It's not critical interface in the same way that, say, open(2)
is, but the interface stability guarantee should nevertheless be
stronger than what debugfs provides.

Joel's proposal is the simplest approach that solves the problem we're
trying to solve. The model you're proposing adds a lot of complexity,
and I'm not convinced that the complexity buys us anything.

tar is ubiquitous. The squashfs tool isn't. Treating both dependencies
the same way is a false equivalence.

It's important to make interfaces that work for everyone. Robust eBPF
use should be possible without debugfs.
