Yes, that's another option. And since I'm not aware of any user reports of
the problem you've found I'd just say that non-root users don't use loop
devices with partitions.

Yeah. That seems like another slight catch for the users. Honestly, I don't
feel either of these issues is serious enough that I'd go and fix them. But
if someone wanted to spend the time with them, I won't object :).
