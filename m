OK. I wonder how exactly Android makes use of it. Since phones are not
using hard disks, so should benefit less from large ra_pages.  Would
you kindly point me to the code?

Yeah but I'm obviously not talking Android device here. Will a phone
serve 1000 concurrent read streams?

Nope. Sorry I didn't know about the Android usage.
Actually nobody mentioned it in the past discussions.

It depends. In theory it should be possible to create a standalone
kernel module to dump the page cache and get the current snapshot of
all cached file pages. It'd be a one-shot action and don't require
continuous auditing.

[RFC] kernel facilities for cache prefetching
https://lwn.net/Articles/182128

This tool may also work. It's quick to get the list of opened files by
walking /proc/*/fd/, however not as easy to get the list of cached
file names.

https://github.com/tobert/pcstat

Perhaps we can do a simplified /proc/filecache that only dumps the
list of cached file names. Then let mincore() based tools take care
of the rest work.
