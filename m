OK, fine. So if this is true, then this patch falls apart.

However I don't know for sure either. I would still like to think that 
these legacy ISA system should still insert a bus resource under 
ioport_resource, from which devices on that bus should request resources.

As I mentioned below, I was actually also fixing up inb/inw/inl et al 
for arm64 such that they don't crash the system in this case. This was 
in patch 2/3.

So on arm64 - which defines PCI_IOBASE - we need to IO remap the PCI IO 
space resource. If this is not done and we access PCI IO space, then we 
crash.

However with the introduction of logical PIO space in commit 
031e3601869c, we can test this mapping by ensuring that we have a 
logical PIO region registered. If there is none, then we can discard the 
access.

However this would only be for when INDIRECT_PIO is defined. Maybe I can 
make it work for when INDIRECT_PIO is not defined, or even drop 
!INDIRECT_PIO support.

A final note on hwmon f71882fg: even with the change in 2/3, this driver 
still accesses IO ports 0x2e and 0x4e, which would not be a PCH fixed IO 
port on !x86 systems, so far from ideal.

I saw that in commit 746cdfbf01c0 ("hwmon: Avoid building drivers for 
powerpc that read/write ISA addresses"), PPC would not build these 
drivers, as, like arm, it has no native ISA.
