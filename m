Well, I guess I'll just add __GFP_COMP so I at least don't get spammed with
useless bug reports.

But I don't think it's in any way acceptable to change the semantics of the
kernel's page allocator but only under some obscure config option, don't
document it anywhere, ignore the known problems for years, say that the option
is broken anyway so it shouldn't be used, and have to exchange 15 emails to get
anything resembling an explanation.
