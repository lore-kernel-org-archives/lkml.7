We are not using ECAM here instead only pick 4KB region from this 256 KB region
and program iATU (internal Address Translation Unit) of PCIe with the B:D:F of
the configuration space that is of interest to be able to view the respective
config space in that 4KB space. It is a hardware requirement to reserve 256KB of
space (though we use only 4K to access configuration space of any downstream B:D:F)

Root port configuration space is hidden by default and 'dbi' property tells us
where we would like to *view* it. For this, we use a portion of window-1 aperture
and use it as 'dbi' base to *view* the config space of root port.
Basically Window-1 and window-2 are the umbrella entries (which I added based on
suggestion from Stephen Warren <swarren@nvidia.com> ) to give a complete picture of
number of apertures available and what they are used for. The windows 1 & 2 as such
are not used by the driver directly.

This is a new entry and not a standard Designware binding. I'll remove _clk
from the name in the next patch series.

Yes. Since the platforms like Jetson-Xavier based on T194 are going to go in
open market, we are providing these configuration options and hence they are
optional

Not really. The programming that should take place based on these flags need to
happen before PCIe link up and if we were to find them during run time, we can do
that only after the link is up. So, to avoid this chicken and egg situation, these
are passed as DT options

This is a hardware feature for safety and can be enabled if required. So, I made it
as an optional feature that can be controlled through DT.

There could be platforms (automotive based), where it is not required to power down
controllers and hence needed a flag to control powering down of controllers

Enabling power supplies is just one example, but there could be platforms where
programming of some GPIOs should happen (to configure muxes properly on PCB etc...)
before going for enumeration. All such GPIOs can be passed through this DT option.

It is required for designware specific code to work properly. It is specified

Ultimately Controller-ID is passed to BPMP-FW and a BPMP handle is required for that
which gets derived from this BPMP phandle.

Ok. I'll take of it in the next patch series

I'll change it to "reg_base"
