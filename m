Yes i can use the lower bit of struct page * pointer it should be safe on
all architecture. I wanted to change the bv_page field name to make sure
that we catch anyone doing any direct dereference. Do you prefer keeping a
page pointer there ?

The issue is that bio_vec is use, on its own, outside of bios and for
those use cases i need to track the GUP status within the bio_vec. Thus
it is easier to use the same mechanisms for bio too as adding a flag to
bio would mean that i also have to audit all code path that could merge
bios. While i believe it should be restrictred to block/blk-merge.c it
seems some block and some fs have spawn some custom bio manipulation
(md comes to mind). So using same mechanism for bio_vec and bio seems
like a safer and easier course of action.

Cheers,
Jérôme
