During probe, ie. discovery, a device wouldn't have a driver attached,
so we'd fall through to simply printing the link status.  Nothing
lost afaict.  The "report" verb doesn't have a subject here, report to
whom?  Therefore I thought it reasonable that a driver ask that it be
reported to them via a callback.  I don't see that as such a stretch of
the interface.

Not without introducing a tracking variable, ex.

bool handled = false;

lock()
if (stuff) {
  link_change()
  handled = true;
}
unlock()

if (!handled)
  dmesg spew

That's not markedly better imo, but if it's preferred I can send a v2.
Thanks,
