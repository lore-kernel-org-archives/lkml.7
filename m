Hm, another idea.  It is possible to inject the ExtInt in APICv, but if
interrupt injection is currently disabled, we need to wait until the
interrupt window opens, which can't be done with int_* controls n.

Wouldn't intercepting IRET/STGI/IF writes be enough to eventually reach
the point where we can do event_inj?

Thanks.
