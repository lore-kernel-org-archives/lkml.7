So I agree that the clearing is wrong. But I don't agree with just deleting
the line. We could have JOURNAL_CHECKSUM in s_def_mount_opt in nojournal
mode and in such case we don't want to show in /proc/mounts
nojournal_checksum as a mount option. So the line should be really fixed
to:

	sbi->s_def_mount_opt &= ~EXT4_MOUNT_JOURNAL_CHECKSUM;
