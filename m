Subject: [PATCH v8 00/10] crypto: add EC-RDSA (GOST 34.10) algorithm

This patchset changes akcipher API to support ECDSA style signature
verification, augments x509 parser to make it work with EC-RDSA certificates,
and, finally, implements EC-RDSA (GOST 34.10) signature verification and its
integration with IMA.

Special request to Mimi Zohar and David Howells to Ack relevant commits, please.

This patchset should be applied over cryptodev tree commit 4e5180eb3d4f

Changes since v7:
- Do not check callback validity in akcipher requests, instead define default
  callbacks on register, suggested by Herbert Xu.
- Sanity checks in crypto_akcipher_maxsize are removed (not needed).
- Sanity checks for `dst' and `dst_len' are removed from verify op (not
  needed in akcipher API and should be checked by a driver).
- Patch "KEYS: report to keyctl only actually supported key ops" is removed,
  as it would affect user-space API.

Changes since (v5-v6):
- set_params API is removed in favor of appending parameters into a key stream,
  as requested by Herbert Xu.
- verify op signature de-kmemdup'ed (as requested by David Howells) in separate
  patch (as requested by Herbert Xu).
- Add forgotten ASN.1 parser files to EC-RDSA patch.
- Tested on x86_64.

Changes since v5:
- Comparison of hash algo by enum id instead of text name, as suggested by
  Thiago Jung Bauermann and Mimi Zohar.

Changes since RFC (v1-v4):
- akcipher set_max_size, encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify callbacks may be
  undefined by the drivers, so their crypto_akcipher_* frontends check for
  their presence before passing the call.
- supported_ops flags are set for keyctl, based on the presence of implemented
  akcipher callbacks.
- Transition to verify2 API is abandoned because raw RSA does not need
  sign/verify ops at all, and we can switch to the new verify in one step.
  For this RSA backends have sign/verify ops removed as they should only
  be used (and actually used only) via PKCS1 driver.
- Verify callback requires digest as the input parameter in src SGL, as
  suggested by Herbert Xu, (instead of a separate parameter, as it was in
  verify2).
- For verify op signature is moved into kmalloc'd memory as suggested by
  Herbert Xu.
- set_params API should be called before set_{pub,priv}_key, thus set_*_key
  knows everything it needs to set they key properly. Also, set_params made
  optional for back compatibility with RSA drivers.
- Public-key cryptography section is created in Kconfig.
- ecc.c is made into separate module object, to be used together by ECDH and
  EC-RDSA.
- EC-RDSA parameters and public key are parsed using asn1_ber_decoder as
  suggested by Stephan Mueller and David Howells.
- Test vectors are added and tests are passing.
- Curves/parameters definitions are split from ecrdsa.c into ecrdsa_defs.h.
- Integration with IMA in asymmetric_verify(). Userspace ima-evm-utils already
  have a patch in the queue to support this. Tested on x86_64.

Vitaly Chikunov (10):
  crypto: akcipher - default implementations for request callbacks
  crypto: rsa - unimplement sign/verify for raw RSA backends
  crypto: akcipher - new verify API for public key algorithms
  KEYS: do not kmemdup digest in {public,tpm}_key_verify_signature
  X.509: parse public key parameters from x509 for akcipher
  crypto: Kconfig - create Public-key cryptography section
  crypto: ecc - make ecc into separate module
  crypto: ecrdsa - add EC-RDSA (GOST 34.10) algorithm
  crypto: ecrdsa - add EC-RDSA test vectors to testmgr
  integrity: support EC-RDSA signatures for asymmetric_verify
