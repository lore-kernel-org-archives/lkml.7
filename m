Ok, I didn't see it that way.

In fact I was seeing the opposite and was considering it as an 
opportunity to increase KASAN coverage. E.g.: at the time being things 
like the above (from arch/xtensa/include/asm/string.h) are not covered 
at all I believe:

#define __HAVE_ARCH_STRCPY
static inline char *strcpy(char *__dest, const char *__src)
{
	register char *__xdest = __dest;
	unsigned long __dummy;

	__asm__ __volatile__("1:\n\t"
		"l8ui	%2, %1, 0\n\t"
		"s8i	%2, %0, 0\n\t"
		"addi	%1, %1, 1\n\t"
		"addi	%0, %0, 1\n\t"
		"bnez	%2, 1b\n\t"
		: "=r" (__dest), "=r" (__src), "=&r" (__dummy)
		: "0" (__dest), "1" (__src)
		: "memory");

	return __xdest;
}

In my series, I have deactivated optimised string functions when KASAN 
is selected like arm64 do. See https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1055780/
But not every arch does that, meaning that some string functions remains 
not instrumented at all.

Also, I was seeing it as a way to reduce impact on performance with 
KASAN. Because instrumenting each byte access of the non-optimised 
string functions is a performance genocide.

Ok, I'll stick with it then. Thanks for your feedback
