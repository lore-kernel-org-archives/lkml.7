Sure. Just trying to brainstorm some ideas.

Another idea to chip away at things might be that instead of
pbus_size_mem() trying to find an appropriate bridge resources by
looping, we simply pass the resource it's supposed to use (which I
suspect __pci_bus_size_bridges should be able to figure out ahead of
time. So instead of guessing and testing for a bunch of different
resource window types we might have, just loop through the actually
available windows and group the resources in what we have. Once we've
sorted out these patches, when I have some free time, I might try
working out a cleanup patch in this direction that we could test and
merge slowly.
